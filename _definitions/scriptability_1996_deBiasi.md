Scriptability [_le scriptural_] designates any writing process centered on verbalization and textualization, at whatever state of progress towards a finished lexical and syntactic form, but excluding all that is specifically directed at the organization or structuring of the narrative. [...] Scriptability falls, in principle, more under the jurisdiction of a [microgenetic](microgenesis.html) approach, while [structuring](structuring.html) comes under a [macrogenetic](macrogenesis.html) heading.
