When a [variant](variant.html) was noticed, it might be introduced into the new copy by correction, or it might be noted in the margin or between the lines, preceded by some such expressions as ἐν ἄλλῳ (κεῖται), ἐν ἄλλοις, ἤ, γρ. (= γράφεται), al. (=_alibi_ or _aliter_), _vel_. When a copy furnished with this kind of primitive scribal [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) served in turn as an [exemplar](exemplar.html) to another [scribe](scribe.html), he might do any of four things. He might preserve both the variant in the [text](text.html) (t) and the marginal variant (v) in their places; he might retain t and omit v; he might adopt v in place of t, without mention of t; or he might put v in the text and t in the margin.
This confluence of readings from more than one exemplar is known as contamination.
