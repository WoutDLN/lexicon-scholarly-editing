According to the usual definition, a rough draft [_brouillon_] designates, very broadly, a [working manuscript](manuscriptWorking.html) written with the [intention](intentionality.html) of [correcting](correction.html) it for use in the composition or final polishing of a [text](text.html). To take only its literary sense, this definition has the advantage of having a wide application and, to make up for it, the defect, under such loose specifications, of a reduced intelligibility. This explains why the word is frequently used and why a certain embarrassment often accompanies this use for philologists and literary historians enamored of terminological rigor. The difficulty is all the more palpable in that a new breed of researchers--[specialists in literary genetics](criticGenetic.html)--have recently brought the rough draft to center stage by emphasizing the remarkable benefit that the critical study of texts could derive by recourse to these genetic [documents](document.html), in which the work of art becomes interpretable through the very movement that gave birth to it.
