Further, while usage is by no mean fixed in this matter, it is probably better to restrict the term “hand” to the work of a specific [scribe](scribe.html), and “script” to a style of writing identifiable in a particular place or period. Thus, a [manuscript](manuscript.html) may be written in several “hands,” all belonging to basically the same “script”; conversely, a particular scribe may be able to write in more than one script.
