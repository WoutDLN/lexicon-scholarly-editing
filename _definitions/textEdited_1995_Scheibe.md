The presentation of an "Edited Text" privileges a particular [version](version.html) within the historical framework of the totality of "[Text](text.html)"; it is a textual version that the author created at a particular time, that he or she believed to be right at this time, that represents his or her [intentions](intentionality.html) at the time. The [editor](editor.html) may decide which version to single out as long as--and this is crucial--he or she exactly determines and describes the chronological place and the historical situation of this version of the text within the development history of the [work](work.html), as well as in relation to the remaining versions. The presentation of one version of the text as "Edited Text" takes place at the expense of other existing versions of the text, which could just as well have been reproduced as the "Edited Text" of the work.
