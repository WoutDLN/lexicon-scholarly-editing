Perhaps we should just stop trying to map [digital editions](editionDigital.html) to printed ones and instead recognize that we are producing a different type of object, one that we can perhaps call a _documentary digital edition_. This new object necessarily comprises all three components of a digital publication--the [source](textSource.html), the output, and the tools to produce and display it--and it is worth emphasizing again that all three are scholarly products that result from editorial practice.

[...] From the discussion it follows that we could define this new type of editorial object the _documentary digital edition_, as the recording of as many features of the original [document](document.html) as are considered meaningful by the [editors](editorScholarly.html), displayed in all the ways the editors consider useful for the readers, including all the tools necessary to achieve such a purpose.
