If, after some time has elapsed, an [author](author.html) decides to modify a [text](text.html) to reflect new compositional ideas, new stylistic ideals, or changed grammatical criteria, the [editors](editor.html) will have to distinguish clearly between the different [versions](version.html) A, B, C, etc. That is because, while [variants](variant.html) introduced by copists ([transmission](textualTransmission.html) variants) constitute arbitrary textual layers that need to be identified and removed wherever possible, the editor's failure to recognize [authorial](authorial.html) variants, or rather different authorial versions of the same text, results in a hybrid text that does not reflect in the least the plans and [intentions](intentionality.html) of its author.
