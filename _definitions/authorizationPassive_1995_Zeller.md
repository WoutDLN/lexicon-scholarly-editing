Not only do [authorized](authorization.html) and unauthorized [witness](witness.html) documents realize the [author](author.html)'s textual [intention](intentionality.html) with varying degrees of purity, but some witness [documents](document.html) stand closer to or further from the author within the authorized [transmission](textualTransmission.html). There are thus varying, or higher and lower, degrees of authorization. Within a witness document itself the proximity to the author may vary, with [textual corruption](textCorrupt') arising from the momentary inattention of the author, the [scribe](scribe.html), the compositor, or all these together. By our definition, even the deviations of an authorized printing from the [setting copy](settingCopy.html) that go unnoticed by the author are considered authorized. This merely formal, all-inclusive authorization has been called 'passive authorization' (in contrast to the 'active' variety of the author's express approval)--an expression that temporarily aids understanding, but that is not a relevant differentiation for editorial practice. In fact, the difference is theoretical, and not practically applicable.
