**Inclusive text.** In the CEAA/CSE tradition of [documentary editing](editingDocumentary.html), [texts](text.html) that fall between [diplomatic transcriptions](transcriptionDiplomatic.html) and [clear reading texts](textClear.html). While often similar to expanded [transcriptions](transcription.html), inclusive texts generally contain more punctilious reporting of [emendations](textEmended.html) and standardizations.
