A scholarly edition is a publication that provides an important [work](work.html) of literature or historical document that has been prepared by experts in the field. These can be in print or digital forms (or a combination of the two). An example of a scholarly edition in print would be a volume of a play by Shakespeare that includes a long introduction, lots of footnotes or endnotes and [variants](variant.html) of the [text](text.html). Scholarly editions in digital form generally serve the same purpose as the print editions but can provide other features such as including digitised images of original [manuscript](manuscript.html) documents, a search functionality and it can have interactive elements such as maps and videos. [Digital editions](editionDigital.html) have less restrictions in terms of space, so they can sometimes include a large collection of texts at which point it may be called a digital [archive](archive.html).
