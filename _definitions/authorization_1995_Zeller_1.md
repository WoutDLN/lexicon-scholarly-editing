Instead of the [author's intention](intentionality), which can only ambiguously be inferred or suspected based on the written [records](record.html), we choose as a model of [text](text.html) constitution the intention that the [author](author.html) attested to in those records. They provide the authorized text representing the author's will for the [editor](editor.html). These the editor does not need to reconstruct. He or she should document them in the edition. [...] Authorial intention thus proves unsuitable for the constitution of texts and should be replaced by the concept of authorization. The editor's duty is to determine and reproduce the authorized [versions](version.html) (or, if authorized witnesses do not survive, versions most nearly reflecting the authorized ones). Pragmatically, to constitute edited texts by definable rules requires the editing to be determined not by authorial intention, but rather by authorization
