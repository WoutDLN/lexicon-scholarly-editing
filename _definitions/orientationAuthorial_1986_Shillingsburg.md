Both the authorial and the [sociological orientations](orientationSociological.html) are more [“historical”](orientationDocumentary.html) than the [aesthetic](orientationAesthetic.html). The [authorial](authorial.html) orientation usually leads to the selection of authorial forms over nonauthorial forms. The authorial orientation is probably the most important in our time, though it has been under challenge in critical circles for years. Most editorial principles which discuss authorial [intentions](intentionality.html), whether “original” or “final,” reveal an authorial orientation. Phrases such as “the [text](text.html) the [author](author.html) wanted his readers to have,” “the author’s final intentions,” his “artistic intentions,” “the product of the creative process,” or even “what the author did” reveal an authorial orientation. [Authority](authority.html) for the authorial orientation resides with the author, though [editors](editor.html) do not agree on what that means.
