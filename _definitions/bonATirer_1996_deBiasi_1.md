The left-hand column of the table [on page 34-35 of the article], _Stage_, is devoted to the general distinction between [Avant-texte](avantTexte) and [Text](text.html). A horizontal bar cuts right across the table at the level corresponding to "_Bon à tirer_" in the column headed _[Document](document.html) Type_, the decisive moment when what had been in a pliable and mobile [manuscript](manuscript.html) state up to that point becomes fixed in the frozen shape of a published text. Everything above this dividing line belongs to the pre-textual domain and is a matter for _manuscript genetics_ (or [pre-textual genetics](avantTexteStage)), while everything below belongs to the textual domain and is the province of [textual genetics](textStage.html).
