A unit-of-variation or a variation-unit could be described in terms of that passage or section of the Greek NT where our [MSS](manuscript.html) do not agree as to what the Greek [text](text.html) is. By variation-unit we do not mean an individual [variant reading](readingVariant.html) in a particular MS. Rather we are referring to a length of the text wherein our MSS present at least two [variant](variant.html) forms; it is that passage in which differences occur.
