The Text Encoding Initiative is an international committee supported by a wide range of scholarly societies, which is developing guidelines for the encoding of [texts](text.html) for a range of scholarly and commercial purposes. The TEI is a joint European/American project involving scholars all over the world. While not yet near completion, it has already committed to the use of [SGML](SGML.html) as a basic text description language. TEI guidelines are expected to include standard tags for units commonly of interest, and explicit Document Type Definitions for various kinds of standard [documents](document.html), as well as definitions of how to extend the guidelines when new content objects need labels.
