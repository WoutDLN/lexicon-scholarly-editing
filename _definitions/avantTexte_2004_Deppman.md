Such an ambitious program required a new critical vocabulary. It seemed especially important to do away with the philological notion of "[variant](variant.html)," which implies owe text with alternative formulations. To make a clean break, Bellemin-Noël used the neologism "avant-texte" to designate all the [documents](document.html) that come before a [work](work.html) when it is considered as a text and when those documents and the [text](text.html) are considered as part of a system. This proposal has been generally and enthusiastically accepted: the term "avant-texte" has become the hallmark of the new approach and is used by [geneticists](criticGenetic.html) of all persuasions. They use the term in somewhat different ways, some more precisely than others, but "avant-texte" always carries with it the assumption that the material of textual genetics is not a given but rather a critical construction elaborated in relation to a postulated terminal--so-called [definitive](definitive.html)--state of the work.
