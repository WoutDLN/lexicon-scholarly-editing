Questions concerning authorial intention fall into two closely related categories–one for those about the nature and recoverability of intention and the other for those about the ontological status of [works of art](work.html) which embody authorial intention. The latter category involves the definition of “work of art” and the nature of the materials containing the evidence of authorial intentions. […] Perhaps we need a new word to  distinguish these two fundamentally different concepts of intention: the intention to mean and the intention to do. […] From this point on, then, when I use the word intention, I mean the [author](author.html)‘s intention to do–to record a specific sequence of words and [punctuation](punctuation.html) that he thinks verbalize his meaning (whether premeditated or newly discovered). It is this concept of authorial intention which drives [editors](editorScholarly.html) and critics to continue to use the word intention when dealing with the authority inherent in the initiator of utterance or discource. The corollary is that from here on I will not use intention to indicate the author’s intended meaning–which, if not irrelevant to critical and editorial concerns, is in any case irrecoverable with certainty.
