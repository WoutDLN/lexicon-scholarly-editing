_Second: critical._ To achieve a broad understanding of all kinds of [scholarly editions](editionScholarly.html), those that are out there now or which could possibly be created in the future, we have to start with an open and wide notion of _critical_. We cannot constrain our understanding to the most prominent exponent of criticism, which is _[textual criticism](textualCriticism.html)_. Regarding editions, we have to take into account that there exist as well historic criticism, bibliographic criticism, material criticism, visual criticism and other forms of criticism. In short, criticism must stand for all processes that engage in a critical or reflective way—that is, on the basis of a scholarly agenda—with the material in question and help in ‘opening it up’.
