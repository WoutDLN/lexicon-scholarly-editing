Descriptive markup shows the logical structure of the [document](document.html). A document is viewed as a structure of various types of [elements](element.html): a book is organized into chapters that contain paragraphs and figures; a magazine is organized into articles that contain paragraphs and photographs, and so on. The user describes what is to be processed rather than how it is to be processed ([Coombs et al., 1987](bibliography.html#coombs_markup_1987)). The user of a descriptive markup system need only identify each significant element of the document (such as heading, paragraph, highlighted phrase), assign a mnemonic name (generic identifier) to it, and mark the element in the document using this name. The resulting document will contain information about the component elements and their structural relation.
