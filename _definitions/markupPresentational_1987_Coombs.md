_Presentational_. In addition to [marking up](markup.html) lower level [elements](element.html) with [punctuation](punctuation.html), [authors](author.html) mark up the higher level [entities](entity.html) in a variety of ways to make the presentation clearer. Such markup –presentational markup– includes horizontal and vertical spacing, [folios](folio.html), page breaks, enumeration of lists and notes, and a host of ad hoc symbols and devices. For example, an author marks the beginning of a paragraph by leaving some vertical space and perhaps horizontal space as well. Occasionally, authors even number their paragraphs. Similarly, chapters often begin on new [pages](page.html), may be enumerated in a variety of styles, and may even be explicitly labeled ‘Chapter’.
