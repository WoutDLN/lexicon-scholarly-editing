But whereas an '[author](author.html)' appears only at the moment of cultural recognition, a 'writer' is simplyÂ _one who writes_ and is born at the moment of writing, not through the conferring of the status of social recognition. An author is a social construct; a writer is one who performs a human process. Of course, all authors are writers (except, I suppose, for plagiarists and those who hire their writing out), but if we want to know about the personal and social causes of [revision](revision.html) and [versions](version.html) of [texts](text.html), we must study the [processes of writing](writingProcess.html), which are inseparable from the person writing and worry elsewhere about the sociology of Authorship.
