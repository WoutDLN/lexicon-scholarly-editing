Note that we use the word _highlighted_ here to include any form of visual salience, whether it is a passage in italic embedded in one predominantly set in roman font, or the reverse, or (as above) a passage in roman embedded in one predominantly in gothic. If we extend the meaning of the term to include passages set off by quotation marks of various kinds, the list of motivations for highlighting expands to include passages of direct speech, material cited or quoted from elsewhere, or which the writer wishes to indicate as being in some sense non-[authorial](authorial.html), words which are being talked about rather than used... and so on and so forth.
