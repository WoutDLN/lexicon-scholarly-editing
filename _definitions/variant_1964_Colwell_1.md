A variant (or [variant reading](readingVariant.html)) is one of the possible alternative readings which are found in a [variation-unit](variantLocation.html). This definition avoids defining a variant relative to any single [MS](manuscript.html) or printed [text](text.html). Rather it establishes the variantÂ reading empirically as part of the total scheme of differences known to exist in the MS [tradition](textualTransmission.html).
