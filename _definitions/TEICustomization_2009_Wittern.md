One of the important goals in revising the existing [Guidelines](TEIGuidelines.html) and developing P5 had been the simplification of the customization process which was difficult to understand and tedious to implement in previous versions. The [TEI](TEI.html) Council accordingly spent considerable time in designing and implementing the new [class](class.html)-based modular infrastructure building blocks. In this new system, customization is not an afterthought but is required for virtually every use of the TEI.
