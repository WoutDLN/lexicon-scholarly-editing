One rather banal observation suffices to suggest what is involved: the [definitive text](textDefinitive.html) of a published or a publishable work is, with very few exceptions, the result of a [process](writingProcess.html), that is, a progressive transformation, an investment of time that the [author](author.html) has devoted to researching [documents](document.html), writing, [correcting](correction.html) and recorrecting, etc. The literary work, closed in its perfected form and in a state of equilibrium that seems to be the immediate expression of its own internal necessity, nonetheless remains the mediated product of its own [genesis](genesis.html).
