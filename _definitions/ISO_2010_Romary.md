ISO (International Organisation for Standardization) is the major international standardisation body, federating the work of national bodies worldwide and covering basically all types of technical fields. ISO has published so far more then 17,000 standards, which at first were only distributed in [paper](paper.html) format, and which progressively have been integrated within an electronic [document](document.html) workflow. For all standards ISO ensures that the content is the result of a consensus among participants in the corresponding technical committee, that it is properly referenced and distributed and also that it is regularly updated according to technological evolutions. ISO standards are mainly intended to be published in paginated form for reading, even if ISO explores databases as possible candidates for standardisation (e.g. language codes).
