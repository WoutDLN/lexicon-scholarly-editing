**genetic text.** A [text](text.html) revealing the development of [authoritative](authoritative.html) forms of the [work](work.html). An operative definition of _[authority](authority.html)_ is necessary to determine what a genetic text will or should include. For example, a genetic text that includes all [variants](variant.html) from all [documents](document.html) in the development of a work is implementing a documentary definition of authority. A genetic text, on the other hand, that implements an [authorial](authorial.html) definition of _authority_ will omit from the record of [genesis](genesis.html) any textual material that did not originate with or receive the sanction of the [author](author.html), unless such nonauthoritative matters impinged upon the author's consciousness, influencing other alterations that the author did make.
