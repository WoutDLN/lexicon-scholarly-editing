one speaks of “contamination” when a witness does not limit itself to reproducing (usually adding further [innovations](innovation.html)) the characteristics of a single antecedent (in Pasquali’s terminology: vertical tradition), but has [significant errors](errorIndicative.html) in common with [mss.](manuscript.html) from other families in the [stemma](stemma.html) (Pasquali, again, calls this horizontal or transversal tradition).
