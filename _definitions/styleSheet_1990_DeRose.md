With the [OHCO](TextOHCO.html) model one need only identify the elements of a [document](document.html); some or all considerations of final formatting can be deferred. A particular benefit is the ability to simply use generic format definitions or ‘style sheets’ to format a document according to a predefined style. As [SGML](SGML.html) becomes more widely used, these definitions are becoming available for many publishers’ house styles.
