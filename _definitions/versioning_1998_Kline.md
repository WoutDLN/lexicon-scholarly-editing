**Versioning.** A method of [editing](editingScholarly.html) whose goal is to give the reader equally convenient access to more than one [version](version.html) of a [text](text.html) rather than to a single [clear text](textClear.html) from which the [variant](variant.html) versions must be laboriously reconstructed from textual notes.
