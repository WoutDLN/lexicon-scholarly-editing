Machine-readable [versions](version.html) make it more clear to us what texts are and what [text editing](editingScholarly.html) means: Texts are not [objectively](objectivity.html) existing entities which just need to be discovered and presented, but entities which have to be constructed. They are products of both the [author](author.html) and the reader.
