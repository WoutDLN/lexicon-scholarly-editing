To distinguish the published [text](text.html) from the preceding [versions](version.html), Jean Bellemin-Noël introduced the notion of _avant texte_ (pre-text) in 1972. [Archives](archive.html) often arrange the [manuscripts](manuscript.html) teleologically according to the final narrative structure. A [genetic](genesis.html) study, however, may require a chronological (re)arrangement of the manuscripts. In order to do so, a [decipherment](deciphering.html) is necessary, and a [transcription](transcription.html) advisable, both to facilitate one's own work and to make the material more accessible to others. All these acts of interpretation turn the [documents](document.html) into an interpretable complex of _avant-texte_. Pierre-Marc de Biasi defines the _avant-texte_ as the result of the critical analysis and organization of all the extant documents relating to the [writing process](writingProcess.html) one intends to examine (_Génétique des textes_ 30-31). The _avant-texte_ does not denote the materiality of the manuscripts nor their actual interpretation, but the critical reconstruction of the documents
