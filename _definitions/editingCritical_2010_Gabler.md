To edit texts critically means, precisely, to construct them. Conversely, the constructed texts of editions are in essence the products of criticism. This is as true in the essentially two-dimensional medium of [paper](paper.html) and the book as it is in the virtual, multi-dimensional digital medium. Therefore, in theorizing the [digital edition](editionDigital.html) of the future, we need to account, too, for the critical dimension, indeed the critical nature of the editorial enterprise and its outcome in the [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html).
