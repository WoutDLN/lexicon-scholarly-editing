OA today is different from its origins. It has grown in many ways, not the least of which is in defining what is and is not OA publishing. In its early days, OA was a movement to make research freely available without barriers. The objective was articulated by early proponents Tim Brody and Stevan Harnad in a one liner: “to maximize research <u>impact</u> by maximizing research <u>access</u>.” The movement was researcher based. It never was intended to respond to perceived injustices of the time including libraries’ budget concerns with escalating serial costs, the desire for affordable educational resources, and sharing of research with developing countries that could not afford to buy what was needed. The two OA promoters also claimed the intention was “not to quarrel with, ruin or replace journals (<u>at all</u>)” (Smith, 2012).
