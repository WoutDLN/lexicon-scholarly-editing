To take just the compositional phase, the study of [manuscripts](manuscript.html) often enables us to make out several steps that cause _developed [scenarios](scenario.html)_, _general [sketches](sketch.html)_, and _partial rough models_ to succeed each other (with the function, for example, of developing the contents of an _initial workplan_ or _scenario_, sometimes without shaking off the list-like or subcompositional style that characterized the [first phase](precompositionalPhase.html)). These are followed by _notes on documentation to be used in composition_; then a succession of compositional states in the true sense (that is, _rough [drafts](draft.html)_ proper, which build progressively to full sentences, and possibly to the admixture of various documentary sources, in general process of structuring and articulating the textualized material). Finally, we can distinguish a series of _advanced rough drafts_ followed by [fair copies](fairCopy.html) more or less reworked (causing local rewrites and corrections to an already stabilized base [text](text.html)), at a stage that immediately precedes the fair copy of the _predefinitive manuscript_, and then the [final manuscript](manuscriptFinal.html). These last belong to the prepublication phase but can still sustain substantial modifications.
