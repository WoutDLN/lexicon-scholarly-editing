First of all the historical-critical edition in its entirety ([edited text](textEdited.html) and [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html)) must reproduce all [authorized](authorization.html) states of the [text](text.html) with [historical](history.html) exactitude. Hence, the various states must be kept distinct and must not be mixed in the text or in the apparatus. For example, only one specific [version](version.html), one specific [witness](witness.html) [document](document.html) which, as the [carrier](textCarrier.html) of a particular state of the [work](work.html), represents a unique historical moment or a discrete [stage](writingStage.html) in the development of the work and the [author](author.html), forms the basis of the edited text. Since--and insofar as--[punctuation](punctuation.html) and spelling are inseparable from the historical situation, this conceptual approach does not pose the question of modernization or normalization. The conception excludes correcting an authorized document from another witness document. The result would be a [contaminated text](textContaminated.html).
