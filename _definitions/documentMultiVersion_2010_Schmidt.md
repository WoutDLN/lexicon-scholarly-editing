The Multi-Version [Document](document.html) or MVD mode represents all the [versions](version.html) of a [work](work.html), whether they arise from [corrections](correction.html) to a [text](text.html) or from the copying of one original text into several [variant](variant.html) versions, or some combination of the two, as four atomic operations: insertion, [deletion](deletion.html), [substitution](substitution.html), and [transposition](transposition.html) (Schmidt and Colomb, 2009).
