The TEI ([Text Encoding Initiative](TEI.html), P5, 2008) focuses mainly on promulgating the skill of encoding by actualizing chosen aspects of the underlying TEI [document](document.html) datamodel, rather than the knowledge of how to engineer a document-situated datamodel. Few of the text encoding practitioners are taught data modeling or software design, yet their [XML](XML.html) encodings must be eventually hosted within some software environment. In some cases the encoded document is completed, and then handed off to a software engineer who independently designs a software environment to manipulate it. This disconnect between humanities scholars and the software environments that house their documents can sometimes result in unappealing and underused systems.
