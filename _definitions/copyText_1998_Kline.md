**Copy-text.** The term popularized by W. W. Greg to designate the [version](version.html) of a [text](text.html) that can be considered [authoritative](authoritative.html) in matters of [accidentals](accidental.html) (e.g., spelling, marks of [punctuation](punctuation.html)) for the [editorial reading text](textEdited.html). When only one edition reflects the [author](author.html)'s personal scrutiny and later editions were "reprints," that early copy-text's [authority](authority.html) extends to [substansive](substantive.html) [readings](reading.html) as well.
