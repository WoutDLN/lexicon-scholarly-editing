The proposal that the [text](text.html) be marked and an apparatus of suggested [emendations](emendationOvert.html) be provided under the text responds to the consensus that text and apparatus in modern [edition](editionScholarly.html) form, or should form, an integrated whole. Yet users tend not to consult the [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) to the extent that each [editor](editorScholarly.html) considers absolutely necessary even just for the due use of the [edited text](textEdited.html). Markings in the text and the emendation apparatus cancel again the spatial and factual separation of text and apparatus that had become necessary because of the wealth of material of authorized versions which needed to be coped with, but which had also encouraged the delusion that the edited text was an [objective](objectivity.html) entity that one could use as a stable basis for further research.
