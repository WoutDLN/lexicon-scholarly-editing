What Barthes said of the [Text](text.html) could certainly be said of the consumption of software. Software, like Text, exists only if used. In such a [paradigm](paradigm.html), use is creation. Thus, in some way the user _produces_, consistent with the ideas of Mallarmd. The important role of the user in the open source movement consequently comes as little surprise. By offering the user not just the [work](work.html), but also the source code, modification of the work by the user is an implication of operation. The Free Art License is a similar call to action. The user-creator must appropriate the work. The intent of the license is to [open access](OpenAccess.html) and authorize use by the largest number of users possible. Enjoyment of the work is increased by the multiple potential uses and users, stimulating new conditions of creation that amplify the possibilities of (re)-creation.
