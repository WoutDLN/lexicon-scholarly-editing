sophisticated text--a [text](text.html) purporting to be a faithful copy but containing introduced [variants](variant.html) that are syntactically plausible. The sophistications may or may not be "improvements" but, on the whole, are considered to have been produced according to faulty editorial principles. _Sophisticated texts_ are _[corrupt texts](textCorrupt.html)_, though not all corrupt texts are sophisticated.
