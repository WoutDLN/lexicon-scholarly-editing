To be discriminatingly analytical of these is a basic requirement of textual scholarship--that is, to endeavor to distinguish [authorial](authorial.html) changes from, say, misprints, miscorrections, typographical constrictions, book design semiotics, censorship cuts, or readership (mis)guidance. To be specifically committed in textual scholarship and editing to the textual process, however, provides a method not only for discriminating by exclusion, but also of discriminating and including multiple-natured textual changes in the editorial representation of the [text](text.html).
