The principle behind automated [collation](collation.html) is that, given a set of [texts](text.html) that resemble each other, the programme will identify and align the matching words and phrases across all text [witnesses](witness.html). Depending upon the collation programme, the scholar might compare all texts to a selected base, or compare each text to every other text without reference to a base. Various tools offer different forms of visualization of the resultsâ€”side-by-side comparison of two witnesses, a spreadsheet of all witnesses that can be downloaded and used as a more traditional collation table, or even a representation of the text as a graph, with text [variants](variant.html) marked as divergent paths. The result can also be used in further analysis, for example in a programme that will compute a hypothesis (partial or full) for the [stemma](stemma.html).
