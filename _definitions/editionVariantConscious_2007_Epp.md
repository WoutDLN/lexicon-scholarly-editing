My not-so-modest proposal, then, is for a [variant](variant.html)-conscious edition of the Greek New Testament, one in which significant variants directly confront the reader. Variants would be, as the saying goes, “in your face!” How might this be implemented? Simply stated, the baseline [text](text.html) (at the top of the page) also would carry, below each line, the major, meaningful variants in each [variation-unit](variantLocation.html). An [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html), in the customary form, would provide the attestation for the variants displayed and also would include minor variants.
