The result of all this is that the meaning of the word 'draft' today has a broad margin of uncertainty. For the textual critic, concerned neither with [manuscript](manuscript.html) nor with [genetic](genesis.html) development, the word continues to mean, according to its usual definition, a vague generic term designating the approximate and negligible domain of all that precedes the finished [version](version.html) of the [text](text.html): a sort of opaque space in which the structures of signification and style are not yet in place and that remains resistant to interpretative designs upon it. For the [literary genticist](criticGenetic.html), on the contrary, whose time is devoted to understanding the pre-textual process, the rough draft is an essential link in the chain of transformations that have led from the project of the [work](work.html) to its [definitive text](textDefinitive.html): a crucial moment in the [avant-texte stage](avantTexteStage).
