Transcription is the seemingly simple conversion of handwriting into print, a presumably mechanical matter. But the [manuscript](manuscript.html) text before mee soon became an object that defied perception. Such a vexatious ‘not-me’ challenges our self-satisfied assurances that [text](text.html)-objects are definable, much less interpretable. […] In deciphering this and other scribbles, one has no recourse but to speculate upon [intended](intentionality.html) meanings, to take leaps. Not only did I find that I had to take leaps to identify words, I also found myself hypothesizing about hidden words suggested by ‘false starts’ or partially executed words on the manuscript [page](page.html), and partially or totally obscured words lurking beneath [cancellation lines](cancellationMark.html). And with a myriad of cancellations and insertions on each manuscript page, aI also confronted the issue of [revision](revision.html) and the sequence of Melville’s revisions. The difficulty of ‘mere’ transcription gave me new insight into the problematic physicality of words.
