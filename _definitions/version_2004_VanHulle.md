A _t_ is recognized as a _t_ because it differs from other letters and because it has a number of characteristic features that correspond with the features of the other specimens of a _t_ in the [database](database.html) (to which this new specimen may be added). Similarly, a [text](text.html) or manifestation of a version of a [work](work.html) may differ from that of another version, but in spite of their differences, there are also correspondences that suggest they may be subsumed under the same title. Whether or not the work this title refers to is the sum of all its [variants](variant.html) is a matter of interpretation.
