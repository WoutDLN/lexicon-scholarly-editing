In a [diplomatic transcription](transcriptionDiplomatic.html) the capitalization of the original will normally be retained, although in some traditional proper names are given capital letters whether there are capitals in the original or not. In some cases it may be desirable to distinguish between large and small capitals--small capitals are letters that have the shape of majuscules but the size of minuscules.
