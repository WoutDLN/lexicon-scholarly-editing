_Punctuational._ Punctuational markup consists of the use of a closed set of marks to provide primarily syntactic information about written utterances. [Punctuation](punctuation.html) has been under study for hundreds of years and is considered part of our writing system. Because punctuation is relatively stable, generally familiar to [authors](author.html), and very frequent in [documents](document.html), the usual expectation is that authors will punctuate their document files just as if they were typing.
