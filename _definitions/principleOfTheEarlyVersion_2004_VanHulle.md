Since the discoveries by Grumach had discredited the concept of the [author](author.html)‘s will as the basis for the [edited text](textEdited.html), [Scheibe](bibliography.html#Scheibe) noticed a new tendency toward the principle of the early version, or frühe Hand (“Grundprinzipien” 35), that is, the [version](version.html) that most closely corresponds to the author’s [intentions](intentionality.html) during or just after the [working process](writingProcess.html) and that shows the direct result of this process. Nevertheless, Scheibe realized that a systematic preference for [first editions](editionFirst.html) would contradict his own starting point of the fundamental equivalence of all versions. He therefore added that, if necessary, the editor should not hesitate to print more than one version. This illustrates how Scheibe’s editorial concepts waver between static and dynamic representations.
