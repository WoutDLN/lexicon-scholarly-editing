By its historicist allegiance, the German [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html) endeavors to do justice to the [text](text.html) so conceived. It is aimed less at the reader than at the user of the edition. It bases its claim to being a scholarly edition on how well it encodes the text in the [history](history.html) of its material writing and [transmission](textualTransmission.html) by an appropriate and adequate [apparatus](appratusCritical.html) format.
