Hypertext is the combination of natural-language with the computer's capacities for interactive, branching or dynamic display, _when explicitly used as a medium_. Or, to define it more broadly, 'hypertext' is the generic term for any [text](text.html) which cannot be printed (or printed conveniently) on a conventional [page](page.html), or used conveniently when bound between conventional covers. 'Non-linear text' might be a fair approximation.
