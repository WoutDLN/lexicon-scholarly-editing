[Authorial](authorial.html) authorization indicates the period of time during which the [text](text.html) of a [version](version.html) represents the [work](work.html) for the [author](author.html). Authorial authorization originates with the [writing](writingAct.html) of the version in question by the author or undertaken under his or her instruction, and likewise with the authorially derived or approved publication or printing of such a version, and ends with its replacement by a new version of the text, or with the death of the author.
