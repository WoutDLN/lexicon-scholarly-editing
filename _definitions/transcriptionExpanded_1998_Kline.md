**Expanded transcription.** A style of source [transcription](transcription.html) that includes [silent (unrecorded) emendation](emendationSilent.html), or correction, of original details deemed insignificant and standarization of formats. The practice gained currency after it was described in the 1954 edition of the _Harvard Guide to American [History](history.html)_.
