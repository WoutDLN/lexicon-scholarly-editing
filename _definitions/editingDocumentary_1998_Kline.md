**Documentary editing.** A term that became current in the later 1970s to describe the process of creating reading [texts](text.html) intended to capture the substance and quality of the [source texts](textSource.html) so that the [editorial texts](textEdited.html) would have substantially the same evidentiary value as their sources.
