It follows from this that no fixed, unique, definitive “Text” of a work exists. The “[Text](text.html)” of a [work](work.html) is rather composed of the sum of the [transmitted](textualTransmission.html) “Texts” of the historically determinable [versions](version.html) of the text existing at any one time. Together they constitute the “Text” of a work in the editorial sense. Each of these textual versions is bound to a particular chronological place within the development history of the work, and each has its unique characteristics with regard to that time and place.
