The very word “[variant](variant.html)” implies a deviation or change from something else taken for a norm. […] So what is commonly done in practice? Some particular [text](text.html) is chosen – often at random – for the norm. Either we use a printed text such as the Textus Receptus, sometimes an edition by Tischendorf, Westcott-Hort, or Nestle; or, we may use the text of a particular [MS](manuscript.html) whose textual affinities are already known, e. g., Vaticanus or Alexandrinus. It is against these norms that other Greek texts are usually compared. And it is this process of comparison which gives rise to a set of variant [readings](readingVariant.html) for the text under consideration.
