A version is one specific form or the [work](work.html)--the one the author [intended](intentionality.html) at some particular moment in time. A version has no substantial existence, but it is represented more or less will or completely by a single [text](text.html) as found in a [manuscript](manuscript.html), [proof](proofs.html), book, or some other written or printed form. In other words, a version is the [ideal form of a work](textIdeal.html) as it was intended at a single moment or period for the [author](author.html). The temporal limits included in this definition acknowledge the fluctuating intentions attending creative acts.
