_Microgenetic analysis_, which sets up and interprets the total compositional development of a short textual [fragment](fragment.html), stands in contrast to [macrogenetic](macrogenesis.html) research, which looks at one or several complete collections of genetic documentation, studying large-scale phenomena. The two approaches will not necessarily work with the same conception of the ‘rough [draft](draft.html).’ Microgenetics might, due to the restricted dimensions of its object, adopt the hypothesis of an expanded version of the concept of the rough draft (and extend it, for example, to cover the development from the initial workplans to textual adjustments made just before publication).
