Shortly after the [SGML](SGML.html) standard was published, a diverse group of 32 humanities computing scholars met at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York (11-12 November, 1987) and agreed on a set of methodological principles–the so called Poughkeepsie Principles–which formed the basis for the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). The TEI soon came to adopt SGML as its basis because it was believed that SGML offered a better foundation for research oriented [text encoding](markup.html) than other schemes.
