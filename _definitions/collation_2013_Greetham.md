For the Alexandrians, the gathering of different copies was because they were different, and could therefore be used to prepare lists of variant [readings](readingVariant.html), in a process called collation (from “placing/laying side by side”) for comparison. Such collation, now often done by computer, though requiring some human input and control, is still done today.
