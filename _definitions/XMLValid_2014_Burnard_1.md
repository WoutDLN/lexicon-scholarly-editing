The reason for introducing [tagging](tag.html) into a [document](document.html) is to label and organize it for machine processing. If the paragraphs are clearly marked, then a formatter can lay them out properly. If the place-names are clearly marked, a program can automatically pick them out to make a geographical index. But this can really only be done reliably if we have some control over how tags are introduced into the document and where they appear. [XML](XML.html) technology provides this additional level of control by means of what is called a [schema](schema.html), a kind of combined lexicon and grammar for valid XML documents. We noted above that an XML document is said to be [well-formed](XMLWellFormed.html) if it respects the syntactic rules of the XML standard. It may, optionally, also be said to be _valid_ if the tags it contains conform to a schema.
