The [paratext](paratext.html) thus is empirically composed of an assorted set of practices and discourses of all sorts and of all ages, which I incorporate under this term in the name of a community of interests, or convergence of effects, which seems to me more important than their diversity of aspect. [...] The final rejection of everything which I christen _epitext_ is probably in this respect particularly arbitrary, for many future readers get to know a book thanks, for example, to an interview with the [author](author.html)--when it is not thanks to a newspaper review or a recommendation by word of mouth. The latter, according to our conventions, do not generally belong to the paratext, which is defined by an intention and responsibility of the author; but the advantages of this grouping will appear, I hope, superior to its disadvantages.
