The essential parts of any [document](document.html) form what we call ‘content objects,’ and are of many types, such as paragraphs, quotations, emphatic phrases, and attributions. Each type of content object usually has its own appearance when a document is printed or displayed, but that appearance is superficial and transient rather than essential — it is the content elements themselves, along with their content, which form the essence of a document. When mnemonic names for these objects are specified, a document is said to include ‘descriptive [markup](markup.html).’
Most content objects are contained in larger content objects, such as subsections, sections, and chapters. [...] Generally, smaller content objects do not cross the boundaries of larger ones; thus a paragraph will not begin in one chapter and end in the next. For this reason, the structure of a document is a hierarchical one, like a tree or taxonomy.
Smaller content objects that occur within a larger one, such as the sections within a chapter, or the paragraphs, block quotes, and other objects within a section, occur in a certain order. This ordering is essential information, and must be part of any model of text structure.
Combining these essential elements, we can describe a [text](text.html) as an “ordered hierarchy of content objects,” or “OHCO”.
