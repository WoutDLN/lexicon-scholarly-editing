Structuring [_le sceÃÅnarique_], by contrast [to [scriptability](scriptability.html)], designates any [writing process](writingProcess.html) focusing on planning, organization, and structuring of the narrative, by large or small units, in the prospective form of workplans and general or partial [scenarios](scenario.html) that will be put to use as plot-handling notes. It also designates the retrospective form of summaries or provisional assessments that can be used to take stock of the compositional state of play. Scriptability falls, in principle, more under the jurisdiction of a [microgenetic](microgenesis.html) approach, while structuring comes under a [macrogenetic](macrogenesis.html) heading.
