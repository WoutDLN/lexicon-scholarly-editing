_Hypertext_ is another buzzword from the dawn of electronic textuality. With the World Wide Web and its underlying technologies, the complex and advanced theory of hypertextuality has been reduced to the practice of simple links. However, even these hyperlinks are very momentous and mark an important difference between printed and digital [texts](text.html). While the former always included rather implicit links and references, the hyperlinks of the latter restructure the contents of editions, open up new and manifold paths of reception and blur the boundaries between an [edition](editionScholarly.html) and its contexts.
