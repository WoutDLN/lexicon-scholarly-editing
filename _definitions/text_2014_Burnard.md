The [TEI](tei.html) emphasizes what is common to every kind of [document](document.html), whether physically represented in digital form on disk or memory card, in printed form as book or newspaper, in written form as [manuscript](manuscript.html) or [codex](codex.html), or in inscribed form on stone or wax tablet. This continuity facilitates the migration of text from older manifestations such as print or manuscript to newer ones such as disk or display. Hence, the TEI view of what text actually **is** is largely conditioned by what text **has been** in the past, without however compromising too greatly what text may become in the future. It attempts to treat all kinds of digital document in the same way, whether they were ‘born digital’ or not.
