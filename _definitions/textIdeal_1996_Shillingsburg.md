The term _ideal text_ is frequently used among [editors](editorScholarly.html) in two different senses, each a concern of this book. _Ideal_, contrasted to _real_ or _actual_, is a term applicable to the notion that [documents](document.html) can misrepresent [works](work.html). Thus, the work is "ideal," while documents are "real" (i.e., physical). [...] The term ideal also suggests a [text](text.html) that is ideal for some purpose--that is, a [best text](textBest.html), in contrast to a [corrupt](textCorrupt.html) or incomplete or damaged text. This use of the term can be applied to documents or to potential texts according to the [orientation](orientationFormal.html) of the speaker.
