Whenever an [author](author.html) writes anything, he or she “marks it up.” For example, spaces between words indicate word boundaries, commas indicate phrase boundaries, and periods indicate sentence boundaries. This fact is widely ignored: indeed, markup is usually treated as an unfortunate requirement of using electronic [text](text.html)-processing systems, that is, as something to be avoided. A careful analysis, however, reveals that authors regularly use two types of markup in their manuscripts: [punctuational](markupPunctuational.html), for example, placing periods at ends of sentences; and [presentational](markupPresentational.html), for example, numbering [pages](page.html). Thus, markup cannot be escaped because our writing systems require it.
