Whenever discrete poetic '[texts](text.html)' --etymologically  something woven-- are organized by their [author](author.html) (or coauthors) into a collection, they form what I shall call a 'contexture,' a larger whole fabricated from integral parts. In other words, Frost's 'poem' that is the 'book itself' is the contexture of the twenty-five poems it contains.
