The manuscript is not the [text](text.html); it holds, it signifies the text. What we ‘have’ is the manuscript alone. We use it as a starting point to arrive at the text, and we go back to it to verify the text we have attained (by interpreting the manuscript). The manuscript [record](record.html) is in its contingency irrelevant for the text itself, but essential for the constitution of the text.
