Furthermore, the presence surrounding a [text](text.html) of para-textual messages, of which I propose a first summary inventory which is probably in no way exhaustive, is not uniformly constant and systematic: there exist books without a preface, [authors](author.html) who refuse interviews, and periods have been known where the inscription of an author's name, and even of a title, was not obligatory. The ways and means of the paratext are modified unceasingly according to periods, cultures, genres, authors, [works](work.html), editions fo the same work, with sometimes considerable differences of pressure: it is a recognized fact that a "media dominated" period multiplies around texts a type of discourse unknown in the classical world, and a fortiori in antiquity and the Middle Ages, periods in which texts frequently circulated in their almost raw state, in the form of manuscripts lacking any formula of presentation.
