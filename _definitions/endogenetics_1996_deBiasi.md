Endogenetics designates any [writing process](writingProcess.html) focusing on a reflexive or self-referential activity of elaborating [pre-textual](avantTexteStage) data, be it exploratory, conceptual, structuring, or textualizing work, and regardless of the nature or state of such elaboration. I will therefore call endogenetics the process by which the [writer](writer.html) conceives of, elaborates, and transfigures pre-textual material, without recourse to outside [documents](document.html) or information, through simple reformulation or internal transformation of previous pre-textual data.
