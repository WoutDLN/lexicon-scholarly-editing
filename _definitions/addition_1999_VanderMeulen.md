_Addition._ The word _interlined_ designates one of the most common forms of addition, an
inscription made above (or when specified as such, below) the usual line of [writing](writingProduct.html). (An [editor](editor.html)
could include above in the description, but in most instances doing so would be unlikely to add to
the commonly perceived sense of the participle alone.) A related term, inserted, when used by
itself means that new characters or words have been added within an existing line (as evidenced
by spacing, the shapes of the letterforms, the nature of the ink or lead, and similar
characteristics); it may also be combined with descriptive phrases to identify other additions that
are not interlineations (as in: _inserted in left margin_).
