Offline handwriting recognition, often referred to as [optical character recognition](OCR.html), is performed after the [writing](writingProcess.html) is completed by converting the handwritten [document](document.html) into digital form. The advantage of offline recognition is that it can be done at any time after the document has been written, even years later. The disadvantage is that it is not done in real time as a person writes and therefore not appropriate for immediate [text](text.html) input.
