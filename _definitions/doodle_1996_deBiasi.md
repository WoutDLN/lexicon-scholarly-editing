A drawing or doodle can be said to be [endogenetic](endogenesis.html) if it does not depict an external object, but is rather the projection of a fictive entity produced by the [writing](writingProcess.html) (the layout of an imaginary town--Yonville, for example--where the action of the novel unfolds; a person's features; the spatiotemporal schema of an action; an invented object; and so on).
