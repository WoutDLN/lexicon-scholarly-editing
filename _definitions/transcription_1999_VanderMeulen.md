First, however, we must make clear that by “transcription” we mean the effort to report—insofar
as typography allows—precisely what the textual inscription of a [manuscript](manuscript.html) consists of.
Obviously a transcription cannot exactly reproduce the relative precision or carelessness with
which handwritten letters are formed, or their relative sizes, or the amount of space between
words and lines; but it can aim to record every ink or pencil marking of [textual](text.html) significance on the
manuscript—all letters, [punctuation](punctuation.html), superscripts, canceled matter, lines linking or excising
passages, and so on. Judgment is necessarily involved in deciding what is in fact present, as when
an ambiguously formed character resembles two different letters; but the transcriber's goal is to
make an informed decision about what is actually inscribed at each point. This definition of
transcription will seem obvious to many people; the reason we make a point of insisting on it is
that numerous discussions of the subject, including some of the most influential, allow for making
certain classes of alteration when transcribing manuscript texts, as if a conscious program of alteration is
compatible with the concept of transcription.
