**textual transmission.** The reproduction of [texts](text.html) from one [document](document.html) to another. Transmission need not involve variation; a text can be accurately reproduced. It may be transmitted by an [authoritative](authoritative.html) or nonauthoritative agent. Understanding textual transmission involves identifying textual alterations and all the circumstances influencing their production and reproduction. Study of textual transmission is crucial in determining the [authority](authority.html) of alterations. When an alteration cannot be attributed to a specific agency in the textual transmission, it is said to be an _[indifferent variant](variantIndifferent)_. Whether a transmitting agent is authoritative or nonauthoritative will depend on the definition being used for authority.
