the term _transcription_ is used with sometimes widely different meanings. [...] In the context of [scholarly editing](editingScholarly.html), Vander Meulen and Tanselle (1999) offer the following definition:

> ... by _transcription_ we mean the effort to report—insofar as typography allows— precisely what the textual inscription of a [manuscript](manuscript.html) consists of. (p. 201)

If understood literally, this definition might seem to take _transcription_ to denote an _act_ (the '_effort to report_'). However, the term is just as frequently used, also by Vander Meulen and Tanselle in the article just quoted, to denote the _product_ of that act, that is, a _[document](document.html)_. Elsewhere, the term is not infrequently used to refer to the _relationship_ between documents—one document may be said to be a _transcription_ of another document.
