Probably the most widely used and frequently referenced [TEI customization](TEICustomization.html) is tei_lite, a subset of some fifty [elements](element.html) claiming to satisfy the needs of 90% of [TEI](TEI.html) users, as evidenced by their actual practice in creating digital [texts](text.html). This was originally produced for a TEI training workshop back in 1997, but with some updating has continued to be useful in a very wide range of contexts, to the extent that some people think that it is the TEI [schema](schema.html).TEI Lite is included (as an Exemplar) with the standard release of TEI, in source and derived forms.
