The Consortium has its executive office at Bergen (Norway) and hosts at the University of Bergen, Brown University, Oxford University, and the University of Virginia, with [Lou Burnard](../bibliography#burnard_what_2014) (of Oxford) as European editor, and Syd Bauman (of Brown) as North American Editor. The Consortium is managed by a Board of Directors, and its technical work is overseen by an elected Council.
