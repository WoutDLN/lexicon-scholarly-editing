At this juncture it is worth recalling that what we call history is not the same as what we call the past. History is a writing up of the past, based on [documents](document.html). Although it may appear to be a primary artifact, a [critical edition](editionCritical.html) is essentially a history, or 'write up' of the primary document in question. The [clear reading text](textClear.html) is the crafted rendering of a past moment of [intentionality](intentionality.html); the editorial notes and [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) are a narrative of the crafting. It goes without saying that such narrative constructs are necessarily [subjective](objectivity.html).
