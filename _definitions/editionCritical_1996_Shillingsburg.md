Fredson Bowers used _critical edition_ to mean a [text](text.html) that derives from more than one [source text](textSource.html). In general that is what I mean by the term as well, but enough disagreement has developed over the terms _critical_ and [scholarly](editingScholarly.html) to warrant a further analysis.
