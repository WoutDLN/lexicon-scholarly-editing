The use of abbreviations, both to spare the [scribe](scribe.html) the labor of writing words that, because of their frequency generally or in a particular [text](text.html), could easily be understood in an abbreviated form and to save [parchment](parchment.html) or [paper](paper.html) and ink, is a characteristic feature of ancient and most medieval vernacular [manuscript](manuscript.html) traditions and early printed books. As an aid to the reader it is common in all but the strictest [diplomatic transcriptions](transcriptionDiplomatic.html) to expand abbreviations.
