The whole operation [critique génétique] is best described as "genetic" criticism, for it is concerned with literary [genesis](genesis.html) (even though the term implies a kind of teleology), the whole process of giving birth to the [text](text.html) when finally the obstetrician takes over from the [geneticist](criticGenetic.html), to recall a nice distinction Guy Rosa has a good deal of telling fun with.
