An [XML](XML.html) [document](document.html) consists of a sequence of human-readable characters, with no special additional codes or binary data. The characters `<` and `>` are used to mark the start and end of tags within this sequence. A tag may be a start-tag (such as `<p>`) or an end-tag (such as `</p>`). A tag always begins with a name (`doc`, `p`, `placeName` in the above example) and may also contain [attribute](attribute.html) specifications (such as `n=”1″`). The purpose of a start-tag is to mark the point in the sequence of characters at which some [element](element.html), of a type indicated by the tag name, starts, and the purpose of an end-tag is to mark where that element ends.
