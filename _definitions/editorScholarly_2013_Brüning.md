Following Zeller, it is the task of the editor to document [manuscripts](manuscript.html) as [objectively](objectivity.html) as possible and to give an editorial [interpretation](interpretation.html) of them in the form of a well-defined representation of the [text](text.html) and of the [genetic](genesis.html) process that led to its present form (Zeller 1995, 44). In the German tradition of [textual scholarship](textualScholarship.html), observance of this distinction has proven to be the touchstone for editions claiming to attain the highest scholarly standards available.
