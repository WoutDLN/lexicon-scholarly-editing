For intentionalists, a [critical edition](editionCritical.html) may be designed to approximate a [writer](writer.html)'s intentions at a given moment in the [writing process](writingProcess.html) and is itself the end product of a process of [historical](history.html) 'construction.' Once [editors](editionScholarly.html) decide to make a critical edition of a [work](work.html), they will first collate all of the relevant historical [versions](version.html) of that work and assemble a list of the [variant](variant.html) [texts](text.html) (or [textual fluidities](textFluid.html)) found throughout the versions. And there can be many such variants due to various reasons: the accidents of printers, the censorings of publishers, or the [revisions](revision.html) of the writer. The critical editor's role is to judge which of these variants is [authorial](authorial.html) or otherwise, and which to showcase. On the basis of some given criterion of [intentionality](intentionality.html), the editor will also select one complete version of the work (let's say, a set of corrected [page proofs](proofsPage.html) or the first printed edition to be a [copy-text](copytext). This is a version one chooses because one can argue that it more reliably represents the writer's intentions than the others, and it is the one upon which the editor bases the edition.
