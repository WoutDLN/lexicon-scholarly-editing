Such reasoning also makes clear that the interpretative activity of the [editor](editorScholarly.html) extends over two different areas. First, it means the comprehension of the textual meaning; without attempts at interpretation the individual "letters and symbols" on the [sheet](sheet.html) cannot be read and--above all--cannot be determined as belonging to one [text](text.html) combining all individual signs in itself. From the point of view of the recipient, reading as a perception of the text is nothing other than an assigning of meaning; only through this act can the editor separate texts on one sheet as belonging to different [works](work.html), for example. Secondly, in the editorial analysis of a [witness](witness.html) document, [genetic interpretation](geneticCriticism.html) of what has been read now joins this fundamental perception of the dimension of meaning. The development process of the text is determined by the [textual critic](textualCriticism.html) who not only perceives the syntagma of an individual textual state formed by the individual "letters and signs" on the [page](page.html), but also the "paradigmatic" succession and correlation of the [variants](variant.html), that is, the spatial constellation and the chronological sequence of the changing [versions](version.html) in the witness [document](document.html). And just as the editor's interpretation of meaning and genetic interpretation of the writing are indissolubly linked, so the individual stage in the work's [genesis](genesis.html), namely the version, and the succession of these individual [work stages](writingStage.html), the layers and levels, are both aspects of a comprehensive editorial concept of text.
