The idea of [a ‘clear reading text’] is to permit a pleasurable reading unencumbered by any footnotes or editorial interventions. Although no attempt is made to recreate the typography or [layout](layout.html) of an original, historical edition, this clear reading [text](text.html) in a sense emulates what might be considered a first-time or unself-conscious (i.e., nonscholastic) reading experience.
