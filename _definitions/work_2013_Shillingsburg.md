I would define the term “work” in two ways: first, as a category into which we place all [texts](text.html) that appear to be [versions](version.html) of the same artistic unit, including all [editions](editionScholarly.html) and printings regardless of accuracy or [authority](authority.html). And, second, “work” is conceptually that which is implied by the authoritative texts. The second definition leaves open the question what is meant by authoritative, but each archivist or [editor](editorScholarly.html) has to articulate that meaning in order to limit the range of [documents](document.html) to be collected or represented.
