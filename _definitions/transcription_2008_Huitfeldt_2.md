In general, one [document](document.html) (the transcription, _T_) is said to be a transcription of another document (the [exemplar](exemplar.html), _E_) if _T_ was copied out from _E_ with the [intent](intentionality.html), successfully achieved, of providing a faithful representation of a text as witnessed in _E_. Often the purpose is to make some representation which is easier to use than _E_ is. For example, _T_ may be easier for modern eyes to read, or easier to duplicate. Or _T_ may be able to travel while _E_ cannot.
