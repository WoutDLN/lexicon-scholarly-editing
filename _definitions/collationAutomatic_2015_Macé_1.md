The core principle behind automated text collation is that, rather than choosing a base [text](text.html) (or reference text) against which all subsequent texts should be compared, the scholar refrains from any selection or comparison at all. She or he will instead produce a full transcription of each witness to be collated, in as much diplomatic detail as is feasible, and leave the work of comparison to the software.
