Preliminarily, then, we can formulate negatively: There is no textual fault (and therefore must be no textual intervention) where one cannot decide between an [authorial](authorial.html) and an [authorized](authorization.html) third-person variant, even when there is merely ['passive' authorization](authorizationPassive.html) of a textual departure (generally described as a [printing error](errorTypographical.html)).
