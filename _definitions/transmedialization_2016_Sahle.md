If asked what is really the gist of the matter in our still ongoing change from analogue to digital media—what ‘the real revolution’ is—my answer, at least, would be _transmedialisation_. The shift from media orientation to data orientation with its focus on abstraction, modelling and multi-purpose representations can be shown particularly clearly for the field of [scholarly editions](editionScholarly.html). Here we see a transition from the edition as a media product to the edition as a modelled information resource that can be presented in media but is about the abstract representation of knowledge in the first place.
