As a theoretical problem, overlap is an intriguing issue for the [markup](markup.html) community generally. For ma[n]y users of the [TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) Guidelines](TEIGuidelines.html) (TEIP4), however, it is particularly urgent and more practical. Because [TEI](TEI.html) users are typically [transcribing](transcription.html) [texts](text.html) rather than authoring them, they must accurately capture the features of their [sources](textSource.html), even if these involve overlapping hierarchies. And since the TEI community so often creates digital texts that must serve a multidisciplinary audience, they must often mark many different types of textual features, which often tend to overlap, in a single text.
