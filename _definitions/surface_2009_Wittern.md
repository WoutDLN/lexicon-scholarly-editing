The <surface> [element](element.html) represents a [page](page.html), or any other inscribed surface.
An encoder can choose to encode a double-page spread as either a single <surface> or as two distinct <surface> elements each representing a single page.
A <surface> element contains information about any rectangular regions of interest on that surface, and any graphics which depict it. A <surface> may bear [attributes](attribute.html), which align it with particular areas of interest on that surface.
