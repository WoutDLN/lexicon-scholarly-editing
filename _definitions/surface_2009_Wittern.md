The `<surface>` [element](element.html) represents a [page](page.html), or any other inscribed surface.
An encoder can choose to encode a double-page spread as either a single `<surface>` or as two distinct `<surface>` elements each representing a single page.
A `<surface>` element contains information about any rectangular regions of interest on that surface, and any graphics which depict it. A `<surface>` may bear [attributes](attribute.html), which align it with particular areas of interest on that surface.
