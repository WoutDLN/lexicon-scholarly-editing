[Genetic criticism](geneticCriticism.html) distinguishes between the undifferentiated documentary mass and the 'foretext,' that mass [transcribed](transcription.html), selected, and arranged in such a way that it can be of use for criticism. For the documentary mass as such - chaotic, often illegible, uncircumscribed - cannot be used for any critical purpose until it has been so organized. A major methodological problem is how to make that move from the documentary mass to the foretext, which has a critical status and can be analyzed by the reader-scholar. Clearly, the foretext is a corpus of signs - mostly words, but including [punctuation](punctuation.html), [crossings-out](deletion), at times drawings, etc. It is not, on the other hand, the totality of [documents](document.html).
