Above all, the collector's [manuscript](manuscript.html) used to be the Manuscript of the [work](work.html): the [definitive manuscript](manuscriptFinal.html), the one the [author](author.html) recopied at the end of the [writing process](writingProcess.html) in order to provide a readable [version](version.html) for the copyist or the printer (or even to offer a "nice" manuscript to an admirer). Yet the manuscript of most interest to the researcher in [textual genetics](geneticCriticism.html), the manuscript-object of study, is not usually this [definitive](definitive.html) lear copy. Although it can be beautiful, precious, and moving, most often it offers a very fixed image of the work. Rather, it is in the [rough drafts](draft.html), the handwritten documents of the writing process, that one concretely glimpses [writing](writingAct.html) in the act of being [born](genesis.html).
