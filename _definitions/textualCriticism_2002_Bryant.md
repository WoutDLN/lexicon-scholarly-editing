While most assume that textual scholarship is the means by which fixed [texts](text.html) are established, it is, in fact, a discipline for the effective management of [fluid texts](textFluid.html). It is also a method for making sense of textual fluidities, and as a ‘making’ of sense, it reflects the judgments of the makers of texts, both the originating [writer](writer.html) and subsequent [editors](editorScholarly.html); it is, therefore, inescapably critical. […] Textual scholarship and editing are professional phenomena that occur when people recognize that a particular [document](document.html) is so artistically compelling, historically important, critically relevant, or even financially promising that they want to see it reproduced.
