It can be proved that two [witnesses](witness.html) (B and C) belong together as against a third (A) by showing an error common to B and C of such a nature that it is highly improbable that B and C committed it independently of each other. Such errors may be called ‘conjunctive errors’ (_errores coniunctivi_).
