Work methods are the general and specific form of an [author](author.html)'s [creative process](writingProcess.html) of production, that is, the concrete way and means by which an author--whether writer, composer, scholar, or whatever--labors on a [work](work.html), prepares it, conceives it, writes it down, and [revises](revision.html) it. In many cases this process does not end when the author presents the work to the public in a printed or at least mimeographed form; the process may also continue later, for example during the preparation of a new edition of the work.
