It has often been assumed that conjecture is involved only when an editor reconstructs or creates a [reading](readingVariant.html) which is not extant in any of the [witnesses](witness.html); but the choice among extant [variants](variant.html) is just as critical, and just as ultimately conjectural, as the recreation of a form which happens not to be extant in any of the witnesses.
