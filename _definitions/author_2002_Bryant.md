_Author_ is a title conferred, late or soon, upon an individual whose writings have circulated to such an extent that the culture concedes and confers upon it a reputation, and while many have achieved this status in greater or lesser degree, the title itself is an acknowledgement of status and '[authority](authoritative.html)'. But whereas an 'author' appears only at the moment of cultural recognition, a '[writer](writer.html)' is simply _one who writes_ and is born at the moment of his or her act of writing, not through the conferring of the status of social recognition. An author is a social construct; a writer is one who performs a human process.
