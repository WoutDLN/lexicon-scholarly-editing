An avant-texte (or a study of [genesis](genesis.html)). This represents a certain reconstitution of the genetic operations that precede the [text](text.html). The avant-texte is no longer a set of [manuscripts](manuscript.html) but an elucidation of the logical systems that organize it, and it does not exist anywhere outside the critical discourse that produces it. It lies in the jurisdiction of the [critic-geneticist](criticGenetic) who establishes it using the results of the manuscript analysis.
