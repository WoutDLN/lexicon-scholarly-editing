**diplomatic transcription.** A rendering in machine-produced form (typing or typeset) of the entire content of a manuscript, marked [proof](proofs.html), or annotated [text](text.html), including cancellations and additions. One can think of a diplomatic transcription as a _[genetic text](textGenetic.html)_ limited to the record of composition available in the [document](document.html) being transcribed. There are many conventions for producing diplomatic transcriptions.
