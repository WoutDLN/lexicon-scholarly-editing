setting copy–known to bibliographers and historians of printing as _printer’s copy_, the setting copy is the [document](document.html) or documents from which a compositor sets the [text](text.html) for a printed edition. The terms _printer’s copy_ and [copy-text](copyText.html) are sometimes confused, but the former is a _document_ (physical object) and the latter is a _text_ (sequence of words and [punctuation](punctuation.html)).
