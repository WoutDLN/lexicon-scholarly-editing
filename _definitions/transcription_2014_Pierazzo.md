The [documentary edition](editionDocumentary.html) differs from transcription in the sense that a documentary edition is meant to be publicly distributed, while a transcription represents the private first stage of the editorial work; a transcription can become a documentary edition in the moment its creator (the [editor](editorScholarly.html)) decides it is accurate enough and follows accepted scholarly conventions well enough to be distributed publicly.
