One definition declares critical editing to be the process of reconstructing now lost [texts](text.html). [...] Another definition [...] declares critical editing to be the process of identifying and correcting [errors](textualFault.html) or stylistic lapses in the text being edited. [Yet] another definition [declares] critical editing to be the process of extracting from the plethora of [authoritative](authoritative.html) evidence an [intended](intentionality.html) text not yet realized. [...] One thing most editors will agree about is that all three types of editing involve the exercise of critical judgment and, hence, could be called critical editing. Most would also agree that the term critical editing applies, whether an editor chooses to produce an [emended text](textEmended.html) representing the critically derived or corrected text or chooses only to indicate those forms in notes or an [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) for a text that faithfully reproduces its [source](textSource.html).
