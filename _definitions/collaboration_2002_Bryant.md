Our most immediate notion of 'collaboration' is that [texts](text.html) come into being with two or more individuals laboring together shoulder to shoulder (like lyricist and composer at the piano) as a single sensibility, but in fact that practice almost never happens. Most collaboration derives from conflict. Indeed, a major cause of [textual fluidity](textFluid.html) derives from the conflicting sensibilities of collaborators, both friendly and adversarial. Collaborators act primarily as 'second readers,' the first reader being the [writer](writer.html) writing. That is, these second readers take a writer's work and provide new perspectives by suggesting changes, in some cases, they demand changes. [...] In virtually all these cases, the 'collaborators' do not work together from the inception of the project; rather, the collaboration begins with one person acting as an [editor](editorSocial.html) to shape what a principal writer has written. Thus, I am nervous about bestowing upon such editorial figures the status of [authorial](authorial.html) collaborator, since authorship implies a kind of unified, originary role not played by most collaborators.
