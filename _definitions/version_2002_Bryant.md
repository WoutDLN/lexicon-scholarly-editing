Literary [works](work.html) invariably exist in more than one version, either in early [manuscript](manuscript.html) forms, subsequent print editions, or even adaptations in other media with or without the [author](author.html)'s consent. The process of authorial, editorial, and cultural [revision](revision.html) that create these versions are inescapable elements of the literary phenomenon, and if we are to understand how [writing](writingAct.html) and the [transmission](textualTransmission.html) of literary works operate in the process of meaning making, we need first to recognize this fact of fluidity and also devise critical approaches, and a critical vocabulary, that will allow us to talk about the meaning of [textual fluidity](textFluid.html) in writing and in culture.
