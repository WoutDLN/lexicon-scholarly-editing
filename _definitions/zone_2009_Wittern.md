A `<zone>` [element](element.html) is used within a `<[surface](surface.html)>` to identify a rectangular region of the surface.
The region which the `<zone>` covers is given by the bounding box attributes, and is expressed in the same coordinate space as that used by the parent `<surface>` element. If a `<zone>` and its parent <surface> have the same bounding box values, then the <zone> corresponds to the entire area described by the surface.
