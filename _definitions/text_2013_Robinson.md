The text is the site of meaning which links the [document](document.html) and the [work](work.html). The work can never have a fixed physical [expression](textExpression.html). It can only be apprehended (and ever only incompletely) in the text we construct from the document. The document without the text of the work we construct from it is mute, simple marks on a surface. Our construction of the text of the work, from one document, from a thousand documents, demands all our attention, all our knowledge, all we know of [intention](intentionality.html), agency, [authority](authority.html).
