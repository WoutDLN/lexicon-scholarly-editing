The conception [of the [historical-critical edition](editionHistoricalCritical)] excludes [correcting](correction.html) an [authorized](authorization.html) witness [document](document.html) from another [witness](witness.html) document. The result would be a contaminated [text](text.html), or a [version](version.html) consisting of [variants](variant.html) which though authorized, were authorized in different contexts, and which in the new context would form a new, unauthorized version that never existed historically and that the author never knew as a version. Such a 'corrected' version would be an unverifiable whole that even the [editor](editorScholarly.html) as its producer could not vouch for either on the understanding of the whole as a concatenation of signs referring to one another, or in consideration of the notion that this structure changes with each variant.
