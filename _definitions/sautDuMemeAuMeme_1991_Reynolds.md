_saut du même au même._ Here the scribe, finding the same word twice within a short space, copies the [text](text.html) as far as its first occurrence; then looking back at the [exemplar](exemplar.html) to see what he must copy next he inadvertently fixes his eye on the second occurrence of the word and proceeds from that point. As a result the intervening words are omitted from his copy. Mistakes are also caused if two words in close proximity have the same beginning or ending; the technical term for these are homoearcton and [homoeoteleuton](homoeoteleuton.html).
