I have also found that one cannot talk about [fluid texts](textFluid.html) without some consideration of intentionality. This, of course, is heresy. […] It is, of course, a truism that we cannot retrieve the creative process, nor, according to the ‘intentional fallacy,’ can we use some magically derived sense of an [sic] writer’s intentions as a validation of or substitute for an interpretation of a [text](text.html). But in the past century, some advocates of this tenet have grown so doctrinaire as to commit what might be called the Intentional Fallacy Fallacy, which is essentially to imagine that because intentions have no critical relevance they are not even discussable. [The concept of] textual fluidity offers a more focussed perspective on intentionality that allows us to sharpen the dimensions of speculation. Fluid texts are the material evidence of shifting intentions. Indeed, the fact of [revision](revision.html) manifests the intent to alter meaning.
