Both the [authorial](orientationAuthorial.html) and the sociological orientations are more “[historical](orientationHistorical.html)” than the [aesthetic](orientationAesthetic.html). […] Some representatives of the sociological orientation seem to adopt the authorial orientation, for they, too, speak of “the [text](text.html) the [author](author.html) wanted his public to have.” But, when they say these words, they mean that authors do not usually want the public to read a manuscript and therefore willingly enter into working agreements with publishers and [editors](editor.html)–indeed some employ wives, mistresses, and secretaries to help transform manuscripts into published forms for the public. […] The sociological orientation is revealed when the help given the author is noted [as a social phenomenon](SocializationOfTexts.html), of interest and importance in itself, and integral to the creative process. Social institutions, and perhaps the historical fact of [collaborative](collaboration.html) production of literary [works](work.html), take precedence over the author. […] The [documentary orientation](orientationDocumentary.html) is not a sufficient editorial principle, the sociologist insists, because unfinished works require the “actualizing” agency of publishing that the author would have initiated had the work been finished. [Authority](authority.html) for the sociological orientation resides in the institutional unit of author and publisher.
