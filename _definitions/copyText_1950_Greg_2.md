The true theory is, I contend, that the copy-text should govern (generally) in the matter of [accidentals](accidental.html), but that the choice between [substantive](substantive.html) [readings](reading.html) belongs to the general theory of [textual criticism](textualCriticism.html) and lies altogether beyond the narrow principle of the copy-text. Thus it may happen that in a [critical edition](editionCritical.html) the [text](text.html) rightly chosen as copy may not by any means be the one that supplies most substantive readings in cases of variation. The failure to make this distinction and to apply this principle has naturally led to too close and too general a reliance upon the text chosen as basis for an [edition](editionScholarly.html), and there has arisen what may be called the tyranny of the copy-text, a tyranny that has, in my opinion, vitiated much of the best editorial work of the past generation.
