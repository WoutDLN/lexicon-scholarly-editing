The term scénario is not recorded in _Littré_ and many other dictionaries of the nineteenth century. _Larousse_ gives: “Scénario: theatrical vocabulary _direction_, figuratively: _ways in which one prepares to trick, seduce, win_.” _Scénario_ was also used to speak of the action or the plot of a play, notably in a written form. It is probably on the basis of this usage that Flaubert forged the personal meaning he gave the word for narrative writing: the _scenario_ (initial detailed workplan) contrasts with the _scratching_ [_pioche_] (composition: as much the action—the act of composing—as its result: [manuscripts](manuscript.html) scribbled over with crossings-out). This opposition could already be found in Balzac, in 1837, where it still denotes theatrical writing, in a passage from _Les employés_: “An [author](author.html) of plays . . . is made up first of all of a man of ideas, whose job it is to find subjects and build the scaffolding or _scenario_ of a vaudeville play; and then a scratcher [_piocheur_] whose job it is to compose the play.” The terms _pioche_ and _piocheur_ seem themselves derived from the vocabulary of sculpture where they were used to refer to the initial [work](work.html) of sanding down; but a metaphorical reference to the vocabulary of the penal colonies should no doubt also be acknowledged. A lexicological study on the history and transfer of metaphors in the [genetic](genesis.html) lexicon of [writers](writer.html) and artists is much needed.
