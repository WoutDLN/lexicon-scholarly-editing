[XML](XML.html) is derived from [SGML](SGML.html), which evolved from GML, developed in 1971 by Charles Goldfarb of IBM, and was one of the world's first 'generic' or 'generalized' [markup](markup.html) languages, along with Tunnicliffe's GenCode. Generalized markup is supposed to separate the form of a [document](document.html) from its presentation, although in practice this is only possible to a limited degree (Raymond et al., 1992, p. 16).

GML didn't completely die out with the advent of SGML and later XML; in fact a [version](version.html) of it lived on under a different name: as the most widely used form of digital [text](text.html) on the planet: [HTML](HTML.html).
