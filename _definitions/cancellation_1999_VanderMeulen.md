_Cancellation_. We use the word _canceled_ as the encompassing term for [text](text.html) that has in some way
been designated for removal. It comprehends methods such as blotting, lining through,
annotating, erasing, and cuttingâ€” any of which can be stipulated should the [editor](editorCritical.html) deem more
elaborate description appropriate (as, for instance, for a procedure that is anomalous within a
given [manuscript](manuscript.html)).
