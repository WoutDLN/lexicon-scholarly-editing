I will define the _collection of genetic documentation_ [_dossier de genèse_] as the whole body of known, classified, and transcribed [manuscripts](manuscript.html) and [documents](document.html) connected with a [text](text.html) whose form has reached, in the opinion of its [author](author.html), a state of completion or near completion. When fairly complete, the genetic documentation of a published work generally exhibits four main phases that I have entitled the [precompositional](precompositionalPhase.html), [compositional](compositionalPhase.html), [prepublication](prepublicationPhase.html) and publication phases.
