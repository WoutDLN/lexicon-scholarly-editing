critical textâ€“any [edited text](textEdited) that results from the application of rationally defensible editorial principles. One could say that a documentary edition that produces an edited text that is textually identical with its [source text](textSource.html) is a critical text because its [text](text.html) was chosen on some critical basis over any alternative [authoritative](authoratative.html) source text. That is, however, a wasteful and potentially misleading use of the term.
