Where [works](work.html) emerge through [stages](writingStage.html) of [text](text.html) and [revision](revision.html), the [process](writingProcess.html) may be contained in one [manuscript](manuscrpt.html). But it may equally spread over a sequence or cluster of [documents](document.html)--a sequence here the advance is linear from one document to the next, a cluster where the process of composition moves to and fro, forward and backward, over a group of [draft](draft.html) manuscripts. Editorially, this raises the question of an orientation text to correlate the draft stages in the presentation. The principles by which to determine such an orientation text are those that in the edition of published works likewise dictate the choice and manner of presentation of the [edited text](editedText.html). Just as a [version](version.html)--materially defined, say, as the text of a specific [fair copy](fairCopy.html) or printing in a [history](history.html) of [transmission](textualTransmission.html)--serves as an orientation text in the [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html) of a work exclusively or predominantly transmitted in published print, so the orientation text of a _Handschriftenedition_ must be a version by analogous historical determinants: an integral textual structure at a given point of development in the writing, and definable in time by document or document state.
