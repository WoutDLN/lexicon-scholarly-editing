_T_ is a transcription of _E_ if and only if:

(1) _E_ and _T_ are [documents](document.html). (It follows that _E_ and _T_ each contain marks.)

(2) A _[reading](readingAct.html)_ of a document interprets the marks in that document as instantiating a sequence of types:

(a) The reading identifies some marks as constituting [tokens](token.html).

(b) The reading assigns a total order to the tokens.

(c) With each token it identifies in the document, the reading associates a type.

(d) The sequence of tokens, taken together with the tokenâ€“type mapping, generates a sequence of types.

(3) Some reading of _E_ and some reading of _T_ exist, which generate the same sequence of types.
