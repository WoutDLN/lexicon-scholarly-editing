[Markup](markup.html) is exposed when the system shows the markup as it occurs in the source file, that is, without performing any special formatting. Exposed markup is typical in systems that consist of separate editors and formatters. Many of the so-called WYSIWYG (“what you see is what you get”) programs do not so much format for editing as expose the scribal markup they elicit and store. Such systems typically expose any electronic markup they elicit as well. WordStar, a sophisticated example of this category, exposes the “new page” command .pa, but also displays a line of hyphens to represent the page break.
