Partly in response to the perception of palaeography as ‘dogma’, scholars worldwide have been developing and employing new technologies and computer-based methods for [palaeographic](palaeography.html) research. This approach, often referred to as Digital Palaeography and situated in the wider field of Digital Humanities, aims to improve and enhance the traditional methods. Its goal is to help efficiently solve palaeographic issues and/or provide more quantitative evidence to palaeographical arguments, and in consequence to cater for a better understanding of our cultural heritage.
