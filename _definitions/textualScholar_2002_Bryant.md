Rather than custodians, textual scholars are the managers and explainers of the [fluid text](textFluid.html). They assemble and record the available evidence of textual fluidity in a literary [work](work.html). In their editions they display these materials as fully as their principles of selection will allow, [rendering](rendition.html) them in one way or another depending upon the degree of showcasing they wish to provide. And they justify their arrangements with arguments based on [historical](orientationHistorical.html), [aesthetic](orientationAesthetic.html), even political and psychological reasonings. Exactly how an [editor](editorSocial.html) might manage an [edition](editionScholarly.html)--whether to emphasize one, two, or all moments of [intentionality](intentionality.html) throughout a literary work--is a principal problem confronted by all textual scholars. And these protocols depend upon the way we conceptualize a literary work, perhaps as a coherent whole, or as a single moment in a process of writing, or as the entire [writing process](writingProcess.html) itself, insofar as it is possible to conceive and then render such processes. If we are to edit the fullness of a fluid text, we are obliged to develop protocols, even ways of reading and modes of analysis, that can elucidate the [revision](revision.html) as revision. This means devising new display strategies for the fluid-text edition.
