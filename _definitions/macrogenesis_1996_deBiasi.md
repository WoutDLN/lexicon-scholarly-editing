[Microgenetic](microgenesis.html) analysis, which sets up and interprets the total compositional development of a short textual [fragment](fragment.html), stands in contrast to macrogenetic research, which looks at one or several complete collections of genetic documentation, studying large-scale phenomena. The two approaches will not necessarily work with the same conception of the ‘rough [draft](draft.html).’ […] Macrogenetics, more sensitive to the diversity of genetic ingredients, attentive to pre-textual structuration problems, and studying objects of vast dimension (thousands of [pages](page.html) long, for example), will tend to privilege a tighter definition of the rough draft, conceiving of it exclusively as the compositional space, completely distinct, for example, from [manuscripts](manuscript.html) concerned with the initial planning, the structuring of the [scenario](scenario.html), or documentary research.
