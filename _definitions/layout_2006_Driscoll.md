Layout means the arrangement of the [text](text.html) on the [page](page.html). In medieval [manuscripts](manuscript.html) and many early printed books there is rarely any connection between structure and layout. A new chapter will not necessarily begin on a new page, and poetry was frequently written out like prose, although sometimes the beginning of a new line or stanza would be indicated in some other way, through a sign of [punctuation](punctuation.html).
