The term ‘markup’ appears to be a neologism, derived from the ‘mark-up’ instructions inserted by designers into [manuscripts](manuscript.html) intended for printing (OED). Contrary to this etymology, [Coombs et al](bibliography.html#coombs_markup_1987) (1987), Sperberg-McQueen (1991) and Raymond et al. (1992) all claim that markup has been with us for centuries in the form of spaces between words and [punctuation](punctuation.html). By this they appear to mean that spaces and punctuation are a kind of markup distinct from markup in its purely computational sense. In [XML](XML.html), markup is clearly distinguished form the [text](text.html): everything between and including pairs of angle brackets, and the white space used to format it, constitutes markup, while the rest oft he [document](document.html) is content (Bray et al. 2008, Ch. 2.4). But they are also aware of the more formal definition: ‘Markup is the use of embedded codes, known as [tags](tag.html), to describe a document’s structure, or to embed instructions that can be used by a layout processor or other document management tools’ (Raymond et al., 1992, p. 1). ‘By markup I mean all the information in the document other than the ‘contents’ of the document itself’.
