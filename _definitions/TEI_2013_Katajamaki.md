TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), now collectively defines a standard [XML](XML.html) format for the scholarly representation of all kinds of [texts](text.html) in digital form. It also provides solutions for enriching the [transcribed](transcription.html) text with information on the material and structural features of the [sources](textSource.html), as well as for instance on [performative](performativeTurn.html), [genetic](genesis.html), revision-historical, linguistic (phonetic, orthographic, lexical, syntactic), editorial and comparative layers of the text. The [document](document.html) as text can then be presented with metadata and explanatory features, as well as links to [manuscript](manuscript.html) images [...], different manuscript [variants](variant.html) or even audio and visual material for more recently recorded examples.
