A schema specifies a set of [element](element.html) names, the names and datatypes of any [attributes](attribute.html) associated with them, and rules about the contexts in which they may legally appear. A schema for our simple example above will say that elements named `<doc>`, `<p>`, `<placeName>` etc[.] exist. It may also specify that `<p>` elements may appear within `<doc>` elements, that `<placeName>`s may appear within `<p>`s, that the attribute `@n` must have a numeric value etc. Note however that an [XML](XML.html) schema still has no way of specifying that the tag `<placeName>` indicates the name of a place, or what we mean by “a place”: such additional semantic constraints must be specified elsewhere, for example by documentation such as that provided by the [TEI](TEI.html) Guidelines.
