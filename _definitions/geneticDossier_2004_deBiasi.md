The dossier of [manuscripts](manuscript.html) of a [work](work.html) can include, besides documentation gathered by the [writer](writer.html), a more or less diverse series of draft [documents](document.html) that bear [witness](witness.html) to the [evolution](genesis.html) of the work: there are _[outlines](outline.html)_ [_plans_], _[scenarios](scenario.html)_ [_scénarios_], _[sketches](sketch.html)_ [_ébauches_], _[rough drafts](draft.html)_ [_brouillons_], edited [clear copies](fairCopy.html) [_mise au net_], a _[final manuscript](manuscriptFinal.html)_ [_manuscrit définitif_], [corrections](correction.html) on [proofs](pageProofs.html), etc. In sum, there is a whole [history](history.html) from which the work issues and whose aesthetic culmination it appears to be, but this history is sometimes so different from the definitive result that one must also see it in a dimension of the work
