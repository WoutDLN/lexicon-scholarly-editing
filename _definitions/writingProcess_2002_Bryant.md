[Writing](writingAct.html) is a process, and a literary [work](work.html) evolves through various stages of [revision](revision.html) in that process from the earliest creative moments of mental [transcription](transcription.html) (when writers make up words in the mind and transfer them on the page) to moments of publication and on to moments of adaptation in other media. The literary work also appears in different material manifestations throughout its existence; working [drafts](draft.html), [fair copies](fairCopy.html), [proofs](proofs.html), and authorized commercial editions. But [textual fluidity](textFluid.html) does not end here. In the hands of readers a [text](text.html)'s material presence changes in other ways through censorings, bowdlerizations, translations, adaptations, and even [scholarly editions](editionScholarly.html).
