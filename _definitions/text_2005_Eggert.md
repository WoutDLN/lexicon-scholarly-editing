Texts do not have an unproblematic objective existence; they are not self-identical, even if more-or-less transparent [page](page.html) designs have traditionally catered to the illusion that they are. Their encoding for computer analysis and presentation is therefore doomed to remain problematic, incomplete, and perspectival. In a sense, a phenomenology of texts has replaced an ontology.
