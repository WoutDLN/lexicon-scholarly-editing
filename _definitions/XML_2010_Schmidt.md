It is well known that modern generalized markup systems, such as [SGML](SGML.html) and XML, evolved from the ['presentational' markup](markupPresentational.html) contained in early digital [documents](document.html) intended for printing (Goldfarb, 1996, 1997). XML, whose specification was co-authored by a humanist, Michael Sperberg Mc-Queen (Bray _et al._, 1998), is used as a [metalanguage](metamarkup.html) to define most of the actual markup languages in use today.
