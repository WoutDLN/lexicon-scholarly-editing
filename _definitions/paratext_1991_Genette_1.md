THE LITERARY [WORK](work.html) consists, exhaustively or essentially, of a [text](text.html), that is to say (a very minimal definition) in a more or less lengthy sequence of verbal utterances more or less containing meaning. But this text rarely appears in its naked state, without the reinforcement and accompaniment of a certain number of productions, themselves verbal or not, like an [author's](author.html) name, a title, a preface, illustrations. One does not always know if one should consider that they belong to the text or not,  but in any case they surround and prolong it, precisely in order to _present_ it, in the usual sense of this verb, but also in its strongest meaning: to _make it present_, to assure its presence in the world, its "reception" and its consumption, in the form, nowadays at least, of a book. This accompaniment, of varying size and style, continues what I once christened elsewhere, in conformity with the frequently ambiguous meaning of this prefix in French--consider, I say, adjectives like _parafiscal_ or _paramilitary_--the _paratext_ of the work. Thus the paratext is for us the means by which a text makes a book of itself and proposes itself as such to its readers, and more generally to the public.
