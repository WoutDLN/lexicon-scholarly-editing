German perspectives maintain two distinct attitudes toward what it means 'to edit the text.' One, represented by Scheibe (and essentially shared by Zeller), organizes an edition hierarchically around the '[Edited Text](textEdited.html).' The other, mainly postulated by Martens (whose views draw support from Cervenka's as well as, mediately, Boetius's theorizings) reverses the viewpoint and sees the [apparatus](apparatusCritical.html) as the center of a [scholarly edition](editionScholarly.html).
