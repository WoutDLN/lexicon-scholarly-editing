The [text](text.html) of a [work](work.html) in the editorial sense consists of the texts of all [versions](version.html) produced in the course of the [process of development of a work](writingProcess.html) by the [author](author.html) or under his or her instructions. It reflects the entire development history of the work. The text of the work is reproduced in its entirety in a [historical-critical edition](editionHistoricalCritical.html) partly in the form of "[Edited Text](textEdited.html)," partly in the form of [variants](variant.html) from the "Edited Text." Note: [Editions](editionScholarly.html) that are not produced as historical-critical editions do not contain the text of the work, but rather the text of one or more versions of the text of the work.
