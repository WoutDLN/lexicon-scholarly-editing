In order to piece this evolution back together, however, these [documents](document.html) must first of all be inventoried, classified, dated and [deciphered](deciphering.html), since they are neither legible nor interpretable in their raw state. The _avant-texte_ does not therefore designate the material manuscripts (a typological inventory of them makes up the fourth column [of the table on pages 34-35 in the paper], _Document Type_), but rather the critical discourse by which the [geneticist](criticGenetic.html), having established the objective results of their analysis ([transcriptions](transcription.html), relative dating, classification, etc), reads them as successive moments of a process
