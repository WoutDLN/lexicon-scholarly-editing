An element of paratext, at least if it consists in a materialized message, necessarily has a _positioning_, which one can situate in relationship to that of the [text](text.html) itself: around the text, in the space of the same volume, like the title or the preface, and sometimes inserted into the interstices of the text, like the titles of chapters or certain notes; I will call [_peritext_](peritext.html) this first spatial category, which is certainly the most typical and which will be the subject of our first eleven chapters. Around the text again, but at a more respectful (or more prudent) distance, are all the messages which are situated, at least originally, outside the book: generally with the backing of the media (interviews, conversations), or under the cover of private communication (correspondences, private journals, and the like). It is the second category which I will christen, for want of a better word, [_epitext_](epitext.html), and which will be the subject of the last two chapters. As should be obvious from now on, the peritext and the epitext occupy exclusively and exhaustively the spatial field fo the paratext; in order words, for those who like formulae, _paratext = peritext + epitext_.
