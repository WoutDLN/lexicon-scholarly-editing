Textual criticism is the art of examining literary [texts](text.html) to authenticate the words, their order, spelling, [punctuation](punctuation.html), and [capitalization](capitalization.html). Authenticated texts are generally thought to be reliable for reading and studying literary [works](work.html). Thus textual critics are valued because they serve the laudable function of providing authenticated texts.
