Following the definitions of Scheibe and Allemann (the latter yet to be discussed), we can now state as a criterion of the textual fault that it admits of no sense in relation to its context; or, with respect to recent literature, defies the specific logic, the internal textual structure, of the given [text](text.html). The textual fault is an element in the text as documented and [transmitted](textualTransmission.html) that is contradictory to the structure of the [work](work.html) in question.
