Second, we exploit the feature of [SGML](SGML.html) that allows [markup](markup.html) strings to be replaced by simpler strings in the [text](text.html). Specifically, we use an asterisk to represent the markup corresponding to a verse line, a plus sign to represent the beginning of a speech, and a hash mark to represent the end of the name of a speaker. These substitutions use what are called short references (SHORTREF).
