"Levels of transcription" means, essentially, how much of the information in the original [document](document.html) is included (or otherwise noted) but the transcriber in his or her transcription. [...] At one end of the spectrum are transcriptions that may be called strictly [diplomatic](transcriptionDiplomatic.html), in which every feature that may reasonably be reproduced in print is retained. These features include not only spelling and [punctuation](punctuation.html) but also [capitalization](capitalization.html), word division,and variant letterforms. The [layout](layout.html) of the [page](page.html) is also retained, in terms of line division, large initials, and so on. Any abbreviations in the [text](text.html) will not be expanded, and, in the strictest diplomatic transcriptions, apparent slips of the pen will remain uncorrected. Such editions are often so close to the originals as to be all but unreadable for those unfamiliar with early paleographic or typographic conventions, or in any case no easier to read than the originals. At the oppositeÂ end are fully modernized transcriptions, where the [substantives](substantive.html) are retained but everything else is brought up-to-date, in some cases to such an extent as to make it questionable whether they are to be regarded as transcriptions at all. Between these two extremes a number of levels may be distinguished--semidiplomatic, seminormalized, and so on--depending on how the accidentals of the original are dealt with.
