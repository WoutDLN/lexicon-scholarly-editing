Between workplans, notes, and [scenarios](scenario.html), initially hypothetical, which facilitate the study of the project's birth, and the finishing touches to a [text](text.html) all but complete and only grooming its appearance by fiddling with a few minor details in the definitive [manuscript](manuscript.html) and at a proof stage, the rough [drafts](draft.html) constitute the very universe of _composition_. They constitute the moment when the project passes form the state of hypothetical schema to the state of textualized verbal material and becomes involved in a succession of metamorphoses that, at a certain [stage](writingStage.html) in the [process](writingProcess.html), will produce the decisive watershed, turning possibility to necessity, probability to integrity. This could be termed the moment of the work's _coagulation_.
