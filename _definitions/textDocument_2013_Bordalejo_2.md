What I call the [text](text.html) of the [document](document.html) is the totality of the text as preserved on its physical [support](support]). Scholars with experience with the [transcription](transcription.html) of primary sources will immediatly understnd that I am refering to all the meaningful mars on the page made by someone with the intention of communicating something. The meaningful, [intentional](intentionality.html) marks that are not script, that is that do not contribute to representation of words or pauses ([punctuation](punctuation.html)), are included as part of the text of the document. To make it really clear, any indications as to which text might be considered [erased](deletion.html) or what needs to be included, marks that suggest a change in order or any other meaningful signs on the page, are part of this text of the document. Thus, the phrase the "text of the document" refers to the complete sequence of marks present in the document, independently of whether these represent a complete, meaningful text in itself.
