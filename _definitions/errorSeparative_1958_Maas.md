We can prove that a [witness](witness.html) (B) is independent of another witness (A) by finding in A as against B an error so constituted that our knowledge of the state of conjectural criticism in the period between A and B enables us to feel confident that it cannot have been removed by conjecture during that period. Errors of this kind may be called ‘separative errors’ (_errores separativi_).
