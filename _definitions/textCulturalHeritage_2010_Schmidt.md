‘Cultural Heritage [texts](text.html)‘ are historical [works](work.html) that have become an object of study. The subject matter maybe of any type including mathematics or science, and the work itself may be in any form, even correspondence or a journal. In spite of this variation in content and form, the study of the text’s own composition: for example, evidence of its existence, how it is written, what it is, how it is structured, etc., is normally reckoned as part of the humanities domain.
