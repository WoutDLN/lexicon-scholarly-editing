The [work](work.html) might see several [editions](editionCritical.html) during the [author](author.html)'s lifetime, and the author would have every right to modify the [text](text.html) on each new set of [proofs](proofs.html), and it would move into the "variant text" stage. These modifications can be substantial, and even lead to new partial recompositions or restructurings, for which the author will make use of rough [drafts](draft.html), [fair copies](fairCopy.html), a definitive [manuscript](manuscript.html), etc, under the same conditions as during the original composition. However important, these modifications (or "[variants](variant.html)") that, from new edition to new edition, can produce perceptibly different [versions](version.html) of the work, do not have exactly the same status as the transformations to be observed in the [genetic](genesis.htmls) [documents](document.html) from the original work.
