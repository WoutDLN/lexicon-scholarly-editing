Recently, the [TEI-Consortium](TEIConsortium.html) asked their membership to convene Special Interest Groups (SIGs) whose aim could be to advise [revision](revision.html) of certain chapters of the [Guidelines](TEIGuidelines.html) and suggest changes and improvements in view of the P5. The SIG on manuscript [transcription](transcription.html) first met at the [TEI](TEI.html) Members Meeting in Nancy in November 2003, and the need for a total revision of Chapters 18 (Transcription of Primary Resources) and 19 ([Critical Apparatus](apparatusCritical.html)) was voiced. It is suspected that these revisions will include ways to encode, e.g. [genetic](genesis.html) transcriptions and [codicological](codicology.html) descriptions, and will approach transcription both from the perspectives of the [text](text.html) and of the [manuscript](manuscript.html).
