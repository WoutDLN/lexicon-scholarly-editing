There is a temptation to use the term _[archive](archive.html)_ to describe such [work-sites](workSite.html). But we need to remember that archival acts and [editorial acts](editingScholarly.html) are, for good reasons, traditionally seen as performing different operations on or with [texts](text.html). Editions turn documentary facts, derived from the archive, into evidence: that is, evidence within the orbit of the editorial rationale adduced to deal with the [documents](document.html). The hardback edition is therefore an inherently provisional embodiment of an argument, however impressive its printed form may be.
