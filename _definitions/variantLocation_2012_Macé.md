A variant location is a _[locus](locus.html)_ in the [text](text.html) where at least two concurrent [readings](readingsVariant.html) exist. A variant location can consist in one word or more than one word: an [omission](omission.html) of several words, for example, is considered as a single [variant](variant.html), not as a concatenation of omissions of individual words, which would not make sense according to the way mistakes in copying are normally committed.
