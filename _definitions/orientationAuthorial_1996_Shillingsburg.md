Both the authorial and the [sociological orientations](orientationSociological.html) are more [“historical”](orientationDocumentary.html) than the [aesthetic](orientationAesthetic.html). The authorial [orientation](orientationFormal.html) usually leads to the selection of authorial forms over nonauthorial forms. The [authorial](authorial.html) orientation is probably the most important in our time, though it has been under challenge in critical circles for years. Most editorial principles which discuss authorial [intentions](intentionality.html), whether “original” or “final,” reveal an authorial orientation. Phrases such as “the [text](text.html) the [author](author.html) wanted his readers to have,” “the author’s final intentions,” the “artistic intentions,” “the product of the creative process,” or even “what the author did” reveal an authorial orientation. [Authority](authority.html) for the authorial orientation resides with the author, though [editors](editor.html) do not agree on what that means.
