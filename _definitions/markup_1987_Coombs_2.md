With the advent of [text](text.html)-processing systems came new types of markup and new types of processing. When prepared for reading, either on screen or on [paper](paper.html), [documents](document.html) are marked up scribally. But, when stored in electronic files, documents may be marked up scribally or with special electronic types of markup designed for processing by computer applications. One uses [procedural markup](markupProcedural.html) to indicate the procedures that a particular application should follow (e.g., .sk to skip a line), [descriptive markup](descriptiveMarkup.html) to identify the entity type of the current token (e.g. <p> for paragraphs), [referential markup](markupReferential.html) to refer to [entities](entity.html) external to the document (e.g. &mdash; for an em dash), and [metamarkup](metamarkup.html) to define or control the processing of other forms of markup (e.g. <! ENTITY dem “Association for Computing Machinery”> to define the referential markup &acm;).
