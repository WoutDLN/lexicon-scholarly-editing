**Galley proofs.** The first printed sheets available for [proofreading](proofreading.html) or [collation](collation.html) after a manuscript has been set in type. Even though recent book production methods do not require that a typographer rekeyboard an [author](author.html)â€˜s [text](text.html), unpaginated proof sheets of that text are still referred to as galleys. Because electronic copy does not need to be rekeyboarded, the galley proof stage is now often omitted.
