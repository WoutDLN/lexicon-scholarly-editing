Where it exists, the pronouncement "bon à tirer" marks the moment when the [author](author.html) decides that he or she can put an end to the general and local metamorphoses of the [work](work.html), which can thus be manufactured and offered to the public in this form. From this moment, we leave the [pre-textual domain](avantTexteStage) for the [textual history](textStage.html) of the work: a [history](history.html) in which the author is still in a position to act upon his or her [text](text.html). It might be diverted via the publishing of a "pre-first-edition" [version](version.html), in serial form in the press, or end directly in the publication and distribution of the "[first edition](editionFirst.html)" in book form. This is the "text" of the work, but, of course, it is not necessarily the final state of the text.
