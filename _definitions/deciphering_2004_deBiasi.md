In [textual genetics](geneticCriticism.html), deciphering accompanies each stage of research, from the first contact with a new [manuscript dossier](geneticDossier.html) to the last corrections of detail in the [edition](editionGenetic.html) and the critical study. To constitute a dossier and to authenticate, identify, specify, and classify its elements presupposes, to varying degrees, localized, partial, or exhaustive recourse to deciphering. Rapid explorations of the [folios](folio.html), precise forays in to the depths of the rough [drafts](draft.html), continuous deciphering of draft [documents](document.html): geneticists spend the largest amount of research time reading the [manuscripts](manuscript.html), becoming familiar not only with the handwriting and its internal codes, but also with the way the [author](author.html) appropriates the medium. Authors individualize themselves by their form of [writing](writingProcess.html), their particular use of [abbreviations](abbreviation.html), their personal way of using the material space of the pages they write on, and their manner of progressively organizing the growing set of written [pages](page.html).

To read or to decipher is to reduce the illegible to the legible (using the appropriate technical and theoretical means), but it is also to reconstitute (on a given folio, or from one folio to another) the capricious and unpredictable line of microchronology of writing. Often the line is broken by [cross-outs](deletion) and [suppressions](elimination.html) or unsettled by a juxtaposition or divergence of [additions](addition.html) ... sometimes the very space is clogged by several rounds of [corrections](correction.html)
