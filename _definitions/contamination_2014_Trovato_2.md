Alberto Varvaro (“Considerazioni sulla contaminatione…”, 191) rightly shifts the focus of the discussion to the causes of contamination, reviving the distinction between two types of perturbation in genealogical relationships:

1. contamination brought about  by even partial reproduction of an editio variorum or an [editio variorum](editionVariorum.html) in nuce (what Segre calls “contamination of [readings](readingVariant.html)” and Dutch stemmatologists “simultaneous contamination” or “contamination simultanée”).
2. contamination brought about by the replacing, from a given point in text onwards, of one model with another (definable as “contamination of exemplars“, or possibly even better as “contamination by juxtaposition of [exemplars](exemplar.html)”, or, again following Dutch stemmatologists, “successive contamination” or “contamination successive“)
