Simply put, a fluid [text](text.html) is any literary [work](work.html) that exists in more than one [version](version.html). It is 'fluid' because the versions flow from one to another. Truth be told, all works - because of the nature of texts and creativity - are fluid texts. Not only is this fluidity the inherent condition of any written [document](document.html); it is inherent in the phenomenon of writing itself. That is, writing is fundamentally an arbitrary hence unstable hence variable approximation of thought. Moreover, we revise words to make them more closely approximate our thoughts, which in turn evolve as we write. And this condition and phenomenon of textual fluidity is not a theoretical supposition; it is fact.
