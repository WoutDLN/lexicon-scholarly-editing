Transcription for the computer is a fundamentally [interpretative](editorInterpretation.html) activity, composed of a series of acts of translation from one system of signs (that of the [manuscript](manuscript.html)) to another (that of the computer). Accordingly, our transcripts are best judged on how useful they will be for others, rather than as an attempt to achieve a [definitive](definitive.html) transcription of these manuscripts. Will the distinctions we make in these transcripts and the information we record provide a base for work by other [scholars](textualScholar.html)? How might our transcripts be improved, to meet the needs of scholars now and to come?
