According to Jean-Michel Rabaté, a new kind of reader has started to emerge in this multifaceted [genetic](genesis.html) activity: an “ideal genetic reader” or “genreader.” This reader is not merely a decoder of textual signals, a detached consciousness, or an emotional being, but rather a kind of “textual agent” who reads [texts](text.html) “in the context of an expanding archive” [2001, 196] in order to see both how they are written and how they are read.
