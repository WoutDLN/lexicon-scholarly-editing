Transcription is the clear (and publishable) transposition of deciphered, “restored” manuscripts and their major characteristics. It is accomplished thanks to a code that allows the situation (linear, interlinear, marginal, etc.) to appear along with the status (written, [added](addition.html), [crossed out](deletion.html), added and then crossed out, etc.).
