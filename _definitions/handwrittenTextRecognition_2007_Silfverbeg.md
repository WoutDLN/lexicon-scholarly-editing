In _handwriting recognition_ (HWR) the device interprets the user's handwritten characters or words into a format that the computer understands (e.g., Unicode [text](text.html)). The input device typically comprises a stylus and a touch-sensitive screen. There are many levels of HWR, starting from the recognition of simplified individual characters to the recognition of whole words and sentences of cursive handwriting (Chap. 6).
