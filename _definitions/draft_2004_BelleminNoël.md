When chance first presented me with an opportunity to study the [documents](document.html) of a writer's composition, I was embarrassed by a terminological difficulty. The French language gave me a choice between two words to designate these documents: [le manuscrit [the manuscript]](manuscript), quite literally the [sheets](sheet.html) of [paper](paper.html) covered with signs [traced](trace.html) by the hand of the [writer](writer.html), and _les brouillons_ [the rough drafts], that is, the materializations of an unfinished, prospective discourse, sometimes rejected but more often transformed through a process of development. The first word posed few problems; one could easily restrict its meaning to the tangible media of the [writing process](writingProcess.html), those objects destined to be preserved by the generosity of authors and the admiration of lovers of belles-lettres. One could use the second term, it seemed to me, to qualify what was [written](writingProduct.html) on the manuscripts. _Rough drafts_ would then include the following: 1) everything that had ever played a part in the composition of a work but had not attained publishable status: the preliminary [dossier](geneticDossier.html), the worksheets, and the portfolio of accessory notes; (2) the drafts properly so called, that is, the first draft and its metamorphoses ([additions](addition.html), [corrections](correction.html), [erasures](deletion.html), and [substitutions](substitution.html)) up to the final state of first publication. This last state could again be transformed by print modifications, called ["variants" [variantes]](variant). [However, when I] considered the semantic and historical weight of of those two words "rough draft"--the ways they were historically and ideologically charged--it caused me to coin the term "[avant-texte](avantTexte)" as a substitute.
