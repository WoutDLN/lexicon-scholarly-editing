n geology those fossils which are characteristic of certain epochs of the earthâ€™s [history](history.html) are denoted in German by the technical term Leitfossilien (index fossils); I have similarly employed the term Leitfehler (indicative errors, errores significativi) for [errors](errorConjunctive.html) which can be utilized to make [stemmatic](stemma.html) inferences.
