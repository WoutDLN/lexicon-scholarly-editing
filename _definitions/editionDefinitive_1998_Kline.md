**Definitive edition.** Once defined as an edition of an individual's [writings](writingProduct.html) that was not only all-inclusive in scope but also so rigorous in textual methods that the reader would never have reason to consult the original materials on which those [texts](text.html) are based. Modern [documentary editors](editingDocumentary.html) are more realistic about the chances of achieving such perfection and usually use [definitive](definitive.html) as a synonym for [authoritative](authoritative.html).
