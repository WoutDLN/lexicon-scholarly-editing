A principle such as authorial intention cannot serve as a central criterion for the constitution of a text, if in the end the [editor](editorScholarly.html) can apprehend it only through artistic intuition (Fränkel) or through the intimacy of personal association (Brod) or direct revelation (Hebling). The [author](author.html)‘s intention, which changes over time, may only speculatively be established on the basis of the written [record](record.html) (or indeed against the written record). In addition, the problem is thus merely shifted from the philological to the psychological plane. We cannot even easily determine our own ‘actual wills’, still less our former intentions.
