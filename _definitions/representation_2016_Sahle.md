_First: representation_. Representation means the recoding of a [document](document.html) or an abstract [work](work.html) and its transformation in the same or another kind of media. This is usually done on the visual layer by image reproduction or on the more abstract textual layer by [transcription](transcription.html). Representation spans a wide scale between materially oriented reproductions of documents and the constitution of new readings of a text—e.g. in the attempt to reconstruct and realise a lost [original](original.html) or an [author’s](author.html) [intention](intentionality.html). Representations try to capture objects in their entirety and can be further transformed into publications. This already indicates a possible distinction between representation and presentation which will be discussed later. For the moment it is important that representation is a necessity for an [edition](editionScholarly.html). [Critical](critical.html) engagement without representation is not an edition—but an examination, a catalogue or a description.
