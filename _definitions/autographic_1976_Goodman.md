Let us speak of a [work](work.html) of art as autographic if and only if the distinction between [original](original.html) and forgery of it is significant; or better, if and only if even the most exact duplication of it does not thereby count as genuine. If a work of art is autographic, we may also call that art autographic. Thus painting is autographic, music nonautographic, or [allographic](allographic.html)
