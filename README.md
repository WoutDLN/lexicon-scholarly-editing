# A Lexicon for Scholarly Editing

## About the Lexicon

This is a reusable LaTeX Template for journals in the Humanities. It was originally developed for [Variants](https://journals.openedition.org/variants/) (the journal of the [European Society for Textual Scholarship](https://textualscholarship.eu/)) by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN).

Although the template and its design choices are documented in the code itself, a [documentation website](https://woutdln.github.com/VariantX) with more user-friendly instructions on how to use it is currently under construction.

## About the Author

This template was developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN), a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Antwerp](https://uantwerpen.be) as part of his position as the university's CLARIAH-VL coordinator. He is also the General Editor of the Variants journal from Issue 15 onwards. 

## Contribute

Guidelines for contributors are still underdevelopment, but a very limited version is available in this repository's [contribution](https://github.com/WoutDLN/lexicon-scholarly-editing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file. As the guidelines are extended, they will move to our [wiki](https://github.com/WoutDLN/lexicon-scholarly-editing/wiki).
