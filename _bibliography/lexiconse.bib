	abstract = {Embedded generalized markup, as applied by digital humanists to the recording and studying of our textual cultural heritage, suffers from a number of serious technical drawbacks. As a result of its evolution from early printer control languages, generalized markup can only express a document’s ‘logical’ structure via a repertoire of permissible printed format structures. In addition to the well-researched overlap problem, the embedding of markup codes into texts that never had them when written leads to a number of further difficulties: the inclusion of potentially obsolescent technical and subjective information into texts that are supposed to be archivable for the long term, the manual encoding of information that could be better computed automatically, and the obscuring of the text by highly complex technical data. Many of these problems can be alleviated by asserting a separation between the versions of which many cultural heritage texts are composed, and their content. In this way the complex interconnections between versions can be handled automatically, leaving only simple markup for individual versions to be handled by the user.},

	abstract = {A selection of John Hale's essays edited by Lisa Marr and C J Ackerley, with an introduction by Beverley Sherry. First published by Otago University Press in 2005. The book brings together seventeen essays by John Hale on topics ranging from Milton’s verse paraphrase of Psalm 114 in 1624, at the age of 15, to his rearrangement of Paradise Lost along arguably Virgilian lines in 1674, the year of his death. Fourteen of the essays were published previously from 1982-2003 in geographically scattered journals, some of them not readily accessible. Three new essays on the theological treatise De Doctrina Christiana are included and, together with an essay of 2003, they apply the subject of multilingualism to that work. The essays are grouped into five sections—“Composing,” “Language-Arts,” “Self-Understanding,” “Paradise Lost and its Early Reception,” and “De Doctrina Christiana and Language-Issues.” Brief preambles or headings are added to each section and an “Afterword” follows each chapter. This five-part structure and the new preambles and Afterwords invest the volume with a rationale, shaping it into a book in its own right.},

	abstract = {The scholarly edition has traditionally been conceived of as hierarchically ordered downwards from a text, buffered and augmented by apparatuses as subordinate editorial paratexts. Of old, the paratexts used to stand in a hermeneutic relationship – broadly, a commentary relationship – to the edition text. Increasingly, however, the hermeneutic dimension of the scholarly edition gave way to modes of positivist accumulation of materials, in support not so much of the interpretive reading but of the editorial establishing of the edited texts. Today, as the carrier medium for editions changes from book to the digital medium, all the main a priori assumptions about scholarly editions come into question. Editions may be reconceived as answering to the paradigm of a rela- tional interplay of discourses, dynamically correlated both among themselves and with an edition’s readers and users: that is, to a paradigm once again of text and ongoing commentary. Relational structures will become realizable because the digital medium will be the native medium of the scholarly edition of the future. It will be the medium to study and use editions; while the print medium will remain the medium to read texts. No longer issuing in scholarly editions as books, scholarly editing of the future will be aiming instead at constructing the material foundations for research platforms as digitally explorable knowledge sites dedicated to multi-faceted historical, philosophical, cultural and literary research and criticism. The digital medium has the potential to develop into an environment suitable to re-integrate textual criticism into criticism – and, just as importantly: to ground criticism again in textual criticism.},

For print the choice of which features to include in the transcription is limited largely by the limits of the publishing technology. In contrast, the digital medium has proved to be much more permissive and so editors need new scholarly guidelines to establish ‘where to stop’. This article discusses a list of criteria and parameters for choosing which features to include in transcriptions. It also sketches the theoretical implications which result from the change of medium and technology. It is argued that the very definition of ‘diplomatic edition’ needs to be substantially revised if the edition is published on the web. Even more importantly, the discussion argues for the existence of a new editorial object which is generated by the changed conditions: a new publication form called the ‘digital documentary edition’ which is composed of the source, the outputs and the tools able to produce and display them.},
