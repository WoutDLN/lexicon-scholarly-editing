		<p>It is worthwhile to distinguish between the useful contributions made by large-scale digitization projects, sometimes referred to as digital library projects, and the more fine-grained, specialized work of an electronic <a href="editionDigital.html">scholarly edition</a>. Each is valuable, though they have different procedures and purposes. The <em>Wright American Fiction</em> project can be taken as a representative digital library project. Such collections are typically vast. <em>Wright American Fiction</em> is a tremendous resource that makes freely available nearly 3,000 works of American fiction published from 1851 to 1875. This ambitious undertaking has been supported by a consortium of Big Ten schools plus the University of Chicago. As of September 2005 (the most recent update available) nearly half the <a href="text.html">texts</a> were fully edited and encoded; the rest were unedited. “Fully edited” in this context means proofread and corrected (rather than remaining as texts created via optical character recognition (OCR) with a high number of errors). The “fully edited” texts also have <a href="SGML.html">SGML</a> tagging that enables better navigation to chapter or other divisions within the fiction and links from the table of contents to these parts. Not surprisingly, <em>Wright American Fiction</em> lacks scholarly introductions, annotations, and <a href="collation.html">collation</a> of texts. Instead, the collection is made up of full-text presentations of the titles listed in Lyle Wright’s <em>American Fiction 1851–1875: A Contribution Toward a Bibliography</em> (1957; rev. 1965). The texts are presented as <a href="page.html">page</a> images and <a href="transcription.html">transcriptions</a> based on microfilm originally produced by a commercial firm, Primary Source Media. It is telling that the selection of texts for <em>Wright American Fiction</em> was determined by a pre-existing commercial venture and was not based on finding the best texts available or by creating a fresh <a href="editionCritical">“critical” edition</a>. The latter option was no doubt a practical impossibility for a project of this scale. In contrast to <em>Wright American Fiction</em>’s acceptance of texts selected and reproduced by a third party, the editor of a scholarly edition would take the establishment of a suitable text to be a foundational undertaking. Moreover, as the MLA “Guidelines for Editors of Scholarly Editions” indicate, any edition that purports to be scholarly will provide annotations and other glosses</p>
